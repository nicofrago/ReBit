Bitcoin ,"This is probably going to be a controversial one, but I have been wanting to make a post about this for a while. I'm going to make the argument that you guys should buy some Bitcoin, but more importantly, learn about Bitcoin.  Even $500-$1000 worth could be enough to help your family if things go off the rails. 

No, I'm not trying to ""pump my bags"" or increase ""the Ponzi"".  It's a trillion dollar asset now, our pennies don't matter. But it can matter to you if it becomes the world reserve currency. 

The accelerationists and technologists have taken over the government. They are intent on weakening the dollar. They want a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Every other country will follow if they do it. Bitcoin is a scarce asset. There are only 21 million Bitcoin. There aren't enough Bitcoin in the world for every millionaire to own a whole coin.  

If any Bulwark people are in here, I'd actually like if you guys could do some Bitcoin coverage. I can give you a few people to interview if this is something you would consider. I believe this will be important and liberals are putting their heads in the sand.

Instructions on how to set up a cold wallet for crypto storage,"I have seen a lot of lovely people asking about how to set up a cold wallet, so I will explain it in the most simple of terms here. I use a ledger cold wallet, so I‚Äôll start with an explanation there. I also see Trezor used, so I‚Äôll also provide explanation there. If you like this post, please give it upvotes so it stays relevant and can be a resource for anyone who needs it:

Setting Up a Ledger Cold Wallet

	1.	Purchase a Ledger Wallet
Go to the official Ledger website (www.ledger.com) to buy a wallet. This ensures you‚Äôre getting an authentic device, not a potentially compromised one from a third party. Common models are Ledger Nano S Plus and Ledger Nano X.
	2.	Unbox and Inspect
When the wallet arrives, check that it‚Äôs sealed and hasn‚Äôt been tampered with. Inside the box, you‚Äôll find the device, a USB cable, and recovery phrase cards.
	3.	Download Ledger Live
Visit www.ledger.com/start to download the Ledger Live app on your computer or phone. This app lets you manage your crypto and update your wallet‚Äôs firmware.
	4.	Connect the Wallet
Plug the Ledger device into your computer or phone using the provided USB cable.
	5.	Set Up Your PIN
Follow the on-screen instructions to create a PIN on your Ledger. This is like a password that protects your device.
	6.	Write Down the Recovery Phrase
The device will display a 24-word recovery phrase. This is your backup to access your funds if the device is lost or damaged. Write it down on the card provided and store it in a secure place (like a safe). Never take a photo or save it online.
	7.	Install Cryptocurrency Apps
Using Ledger Live, install apps for the cryptocurrencies you plan to store (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). Each app lets you manage that specific crypto on the wallet.
	8.	Transfer Your Crypto
Open Ledger Live, select ‚ÄúReceive,‚Äù and copy the wallet address shown. Go to your existing exchange (like Coinbase), paste this address, and withdraw your crypto to the Ledger wallet.

Setting Up a Trezor Cold Wallet

	1.	Purchase a Trezor Wallet
Buy directly from the official website (www.trezor.io) to ensure the product is authentic. Trezor Model T is a popular choice.
	2.	Unbox and Inspect
Check that the device is sealed and comes with a USB cable, instruction manual, and recovery phrase cards.
	3.	Go to Trezor Suite
Visit suite.trezor.io/start and download Trezor Suite on your computer or phone. This is the app you‚Äôll use to interact with the wallet.
	4.	Connect the Wallet
Plug the Trezor into your device with the USB cable.
	5.	Set Up Your PIN
Follow the on-screen instructions to create a PIN for your Trezor. This PIN secures the device from unauthorized access.
	6.	Write Down the Recovery Phrase
The Trezor will generate a 12- or 24-word recovery phrase. Write this down and store it securely. Never share it or save it online.
	7.	Install Cryptocurrency Wallets
In Trezor Suite, select the cryptocurrencies you want to manage. The app will guide you through installing wallets for each one.
	8.	Transfer Your Crypto
Go to the ‚ÄúReceive‚Äù tab in Trezor Suite, copy your wallet address, and transfer crypto from your exchange account to your Trezor wallet.

Why Cold Wallets Are better:

	‚Ä¢	True Ownership: With a cold wallet, you own the private keys to your crypto. Private keys are like the password that unlocks your funds. On exchanges like Robinhood or Coinbase, they hold these keys, meaning they control your funds, not you.
	‚Ä¢	Offline Security: Cold wallets store your private keys offline, making them immune to hacking. Exchanges are online and prone to cyberattacks.
	‚Ä¢	No Trading Restrictions: In cases like the AMC short squeeze, Robinhood restricted trades because they controlled the assets. With a cold wallet, no one can stop you from selling, holding, or transferring your crypto.

"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: $BTC skyrockets past $99,000 as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shakes the status quo by likening Bitcoin to gold during his speech at the DealBook Summit in Manhattan. The milestone reflects a growing trend where Bitcoin is seen less as a payment system and more as digital gold, cementing its role as a hard asset.

Powell‚Äôs remarks served as a rocket booster for $BTC, which bounced back sharply from a dip below $94,700 earlier. He clarified that Bitcoin isn't a dollar contender but rather a competitor to gold, reinforcing the narrative that it‚Äôs ""Gold 2.0."" The market reacted swiftly, pushing Bitcoin closer to that six-figure price mark, further fueling its massive 135% rally this year.

What‚Äôs more, Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance and plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve are adding to the bullish vibes. His nomination of a crypto-friendly attorney, Paul Atkins, to the SEC hints at a potentially lenient regulatory era ahead. Bitcoin ETFs, already outperforming gold ETFs, could get a further boost under this policy direction.

Institutional adoption is accelerating, and big names in traditional finance are finally acknowledging Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. The digital revolution is here, and Bitcoin is taking the lead in redefining store-of-value narratives.

How can I start accepting crypto as payments to my small business?,"Well since every crypto page I've posted in deletes it, I figured that this stupid question might actually get a response here.

I currently run a small business and would like to know if there's any easy way to accept crypto as payment? I would be happy to accept bitcoin, eth, doge or xrp. I'm pretty new to this other than buying some a couple years back on coinbase and then forgetting about it. Do I just create a wallet and give the address out to people? Any place that's better than another to do this? I use square as credit card processing however I don't take more than $900-1000 on credit cards per month; mostly cash and checks, along with venmo. I've had a couple people ask if they could pay in doge or btc which got me thinking, why not?",Mean_Farmer4616,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1h6x5ot/how_can_i_start_accepting_crypto_as_payments_to/,2024-12-05 01:24:49,1,title,0.0,0.03,0.783,0.187,0.9775
"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: Bitcoin smashes the $99,000 barrier, fueled by a jaw-dropping statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the DealBook Summit. Comparing $BTC to gold, Powell shook the financial world, stating it‚Äôs not a competitor to the dollar but a rival to gold. Digital gold, anyone?

This marks a historic moment for Bitcoin as its narrative shifts further into mainstream acceptance. Powell‚Äôs acknowledgment validates what many of us crypto believers already knew: Bitcoin isn't just a currency; it's an asset class redefining wealth. Meanwhile, $BTC's 135% rally this year looks unstoppable.

With pro-crypto moves gaining ground in Washington, including talks of national Bitcoin reserves and promising SEC leadership changes, the stage is set for an even brighter future. Is Bitcoin officially gold 2.0? The market seems to think so!

BTC paid for my college in 2017. Now finishing my MD hoping to be a brain cancer doc. I‚Äôm back in for the long run until my residency is over.  Thankful for this wonderful community. ,"I had another Reddit account sometime ago where I‚Äôd sell TF2 and CSGo items for BTC. Completely Cashed out in 2017-2018 and it paid for part of my college tuition and a laptop and phone. Made it through the expensive med school apps, unpaid research work, volunteering, and somehow got accepted. Now I‚Äôm in my last year. Applying to residency with the hopes of being a brain cancer doctor. I would not be here if I didn‚Äôt have BTC. With BTC reaching 100k I feel sentimental since without it there‚Äôs no way I could have afforded to apply to med school on my single parent‚Äôs 35k/yr salary. I remember particularly hard times watching the ticker so I could sell and buy dinner. 

It‚Äôs been a struggle and med school tuition loans have me 200k in the red but decided a few weeks back I‚Äôd start a small savings and invest what I can until I finish my residency training in 2032. 

While I don‚Äôt know where things will be by then I think it‚Äôs worth the risk. Even now, BTC seems like it‚Äôs reliable. I always believed in the power of a currency built around the people. I‚Äôm so thankful for this wonderful community, all the many friends I‚Äôve met along the way, all the people who motivated me through hard times and helped me manage the little money to my name. 

A sincere thank you to you all. 
May the journey to the moon be a safe one.

C-676 Bitcoin Contract Trading,"Does anyone have experience with this type of Bitcoin Trading?  

Cryptocurrency trading is the most direct way to make money, which is mainly divided into second contract trading and perpetual contract trading. Second contract trading refers to directly buying or selling a certain cryptocurrency within a specific time, while perpetual contract trading is a higher-risk transaction through leverage. For novices, second contract trading is relatively simple and suitable for entry.",headyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1h700ep/c676_bitcoin_contract_trading/,2024-12-05 03:45:18,1,title,1.0,0.0,0.94,0.06,0.5574
"[New victims, please read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/ybxjo6/attention_new_victims/)

As a rule of thumb: If you're doubting whether the site is a scam, it probably is.

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on dating websites or through a ""random"" text message.**

No legit company/trader/investor has ""professors"", ""assistants"", or ""teachers"". Those are just scammers.

No legit company forces you to pay a ""fee"" or ""taxes"" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

You will need to contact law enforcement ASAP.

Unfortunately, no hacker online can get back what you've lost. Please watch out for recovery scams, a follow-up scam done after victims have fallen for an earlier scam. Recently, there has been a rise in scammers DMing members of the subreddit to offer recovery services. A form of the advance-fee, victims are convinced that the scammer can recover their money. This ""help"" can come in the form of fake hacking services or authorities. 

If you see anyone circumventing the scam filters, please report the submission and we will take action shortly.

[WTS] 2013 W Proof $25 Gold Eagle (1/2 oz) NGC PF70 Ultra Cameo,"Hello all, I'll keep it brief.  Have just one item for sale tonight, a 2013 W Proof $25 Gold Eagle (Half Ounce) NGC PF70UCAM, as pictured below:

[Obverse photo (w/usercard)](https://imgur.com/q1YUQMg)

[Reverse photo (w/usercard)](https://imgur.com/56BI2AH)

Melt value (with gold at $2,647.90 at time of posting) is $1,323.95.  NGC Price Guide obviously hasn't been updated in a while (showing price guide of less than melt) so that's not useful.  Online comps on a well-known auction website are all within a few dollars of $1,500 (active and sold.)

Coin itself looks great.  Slab has some minor scuffs and scratches (like that when I bought it.)  If sold tonight, I'll get it in the mail and on its way to you by tomorrow morning.

**Asking price is $1,400 shipped FIRM.**

**TERMS**

My asking price is FIRM and includes shipping via USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Small Box. First come, first served - I do not do holds. I also do not need any trades, thank you. I will edit the ad as soon as payment is received - so I will do my best to keep it updated as quickly as possible. If it is still listed, it is still available. Once your item arrives, we can leave each other feedback.

**Payment**: PayPal FF (gift) only. I do not have Venmo/Zello/Bitcoin or any other form of digital payment at this time.

PPFF (Friends & Family or Gift): If you choose to use PPFF, please keep these things in mind:

    1. Please make sure you know how to send a PPFF payment (it requires an extra step.)
    
    2. **NO NOTES**
    
    3. Please send me your shipping address here via PM as it will not automatically load with your payment.

**Shipping**: I am including shipping costs for USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Small Box (no insurance) with the cost of the coin.  If you would like me to upgrade to USPS Registered Mail, I will do so at no extra charge (but it will take a lot longer to get to you.

Will Russia force their hands,"With the US toying with the idea of adding bitcoin into its national reserve the future of bit coin is looking very promising. With Putin discussing the use of bitcoin as a national currency to circumvent nato santions this surely will pressure western governments to adopt bitcoin before they miss the boat. I am seeing predictions of 20-40m btc by 2042 caused by the massive cash grab that will ensue by world governments. 

Putins announcement seems impossible to ignore and i feel that now its not a question of if, but when governments jump on the gravey train.

Now im not that smart so lets discuss,I am very interested to hear your opinions.

What's the best way to get cheap debt (<5% APR),"I want to buy more bitcoin. I have a high paying tech job, and have already used 0% apr promo balance transfer cash advances to buy large lots of bitcoin, and then set up autopayment so that I service that debt accordingly, which is within my budget.

Long post only because I‚Äôm copying the most hilarious two emails I have gotten. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop laughing.,"The sands of time are slipping away.

Please take a moment to pause, breathe, and focus on this message. It's important to give it your full attention.
Because we're about to talk about a serious deal between us, and I'm not messing around.
You don‚Äôt know me, but I know you well‚Äîand right now, you're probably wondering how, aren‚Äôt you?

You've been walking on thin ice with your browsing habits‚Äîscrolling through videos, clicking on links, and landing on some less-than-safe sites.
I embedded malware on an adult website, and you happened to visit it‚Äîyou know what I mean?
While you were watching videos, your system activated as a Remote Desktop Protocol, giving me complete control over your device.
I can see everything on your screen, activate your camera and mic, and you wouldn‚Äôt even realize it.
I also have access to all your emails, contacts, and social media accounts.

I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on your life for a while now. It‚Äôs just bad luck on your part that I discovered your actions.
I spent more time than I probably should have digging into your data.
I've gathered a lot of valuable information from your system, and I've gone through it all.
I‚Äôve got footage of you doing some pretty questionable things at your house (nice setup, by the way).
I created videos and screenshots (including photos of your home) where one side shows the videos you were watching, and the other side features you... well, you know.
With just one click, I can send this to every single one of your contacts.

I can see your confusion, but don‚Äôt expect any sympathy.
Honestly, I‚Äôm willing to let it all go and let you move on as if nothing ever happened.
I‚Äôm giving you two options:

One. Ignore this email and see what happens. If you choose this route, I‚Äôll send your video to all your contacts.
The video is pretty intense, and I can‚Äôt even imagine the embarrassment you‚Äôll feel when your colleagues, friends, and family see it.
But hey, that‚Äôs life, right? Don‚Äôt play the victim here.

Two. The second option is to pay me and keep it confidential. Let‚Äôs call it my *privacy fee*.
Here‚Äôs what happens if you choose this option: your secret stays just that‚Äîyour secret.
Once payment is received, I‚Äôll erase everything. The payment must be made in Bitcoin only.
Just so you know, I‚Äôm looking for a win-win here, and my terms are non-negotiable.

Send $1495 to my BTC wallet: 17q2dKLYmGPnnaAkcCtQUJXJHhiEiny21y

Once you make the payment, you‚Äôll sleep easy. I keep my promises. You have two days to pay, and I‚Äôll only accept Bitcoin.
My system will detect the payment and erase everything I have on you. Don‚Äôt bother replying or trying to negotiate‚Äîit‚Äôs pointless.
Both the email and wallet are designed specifically for you and are untraceable.
If I see that you‚Äôve shared or discussed this with anyone, the video will be sent to your contacts immediately.
And don‚Äôt even think about turning off your phone or resetting it to factory settings‚Äîit won‚Äôt help.
I don‚Äôt make mistakes. I‚Äôm just waiting for my payment.


You're on borrowed time now.

Take a second to stop, inhale deeply, and concentrate on this message. It's crucial to give it your complete focus.
We're about to discuss a significant matter between us, and I'm absolutely not kidding.
You might not recognize me, but I'm familiar with you and at this moment, you're likely wondering how, right?

Your browsing habits have been risky - scrolling through videos, clicking links, and visiting some unsafe websites.
I deployed malware on an adult site, and you stumbled across it.
While you were streaming, your system was exposed through rdp, allowing me full access to your device.
Now I can monitor everything on your screen, remotely activate your camera and microphone, and you wouldn't even notice.
I also have complete access to your emails, contacts and other accounts.

I've been observing your activities for quite some time now. It's simply unfortunate for you that I came across what you‚Äôve been up to.
I spent more time than necessary digging into your personal data. I've collected a significant amount of sensitive information from your device and reviewed it thoroughly. I even have recordings of you engaging in some rather questionable behavior at home. I've compiled videos and snapshots (including images of your living space) where one side displays the content you were viewing, and the other side shows you... well, let's just say you know what I mean.
With a single click, I could share this with every one of your contacts.

I understand your uncertainty, but don't expect any leniency from me.
That said, I'm prepared to let this go and allow you to carry on as if nothing ever occurred.
Here's the deal - I'm offering you two choices:

Option one: Ignore this message and find out what happens next. If you take this path, I'll share the video with all your contacts.
It's quite a revealing clip, and I can only imagine the humiliation you'd face when your colleagues, friends, and family view it.
But, as they say, actions have consequences. Don't position yourself as the victim here.

Option two: Pay me to keep this matter private. Let's refer to it as a privacy fee.
Here's the deal if you go this route: your secret remains safe, no one else will ever know.
Once I receive the payment, I'll delete everything. The payment is to be made exclusively in crypto.
I'm aiming for a resolution that works for both of us, but my terms are final and non negotiable.

Send $1500 to my bitcoin addr: 1ASC2qjmug4ryR6Vd11LevRq5nXxcQwHMH

Once the payment is made, you can rest easy knowing I keep my word.
You have 50 hours to complete the transaction, and btc is the only form of payment I'll accept.
The system I've set up will automatically detect the payment and immediately delete everything I have on you.
Don't waste time responding or attempting to negotiate - it won't work.
If I notice you've spoken to anyone about this or sought advice, the video will be sent to your contacts without hesitation.
And don't think about turning off your phone or attempting a factory reset - it won't make a difference.
I don't make errors, and I'm simply waiting for the payment.

"Hi /u/1Cattywampus1, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Blackmail email scam.

The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have installed a RAT (remote access trojan) or any type of software/malware after visiting a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video.

Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. If they had a video of you, they would show it to you to prove that they have it. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are some news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam.

There is a variant with death threats in which they will usually claim that they have been paid to kill you, and will threaten to kill you/your family if you do not pay a Bitcoin ransom. They usually also claim that they will kill your family if you report the email. The emails are spam and can be ignored.

"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: $BTC smashes the $99,000 milestone after Fed Chair Jerome Powell compares it to gold. Speaking at the DealBook Summit, Powell highlighted Bitcoin's role as a digital competitor to gold rather than a challenger to the US dollar. This sentiment resonated across markets, fueling an upward surge in $BTC, which is up 135% this year.

Powell's acknowledgment of Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a significant asset adds more weight to the ""digital gold"" narrative that many in the industry already champion. Meanwhile, with the pro-crypto Trump administration incoming, the vibe is bullish. Bitcoin ETFs are already outpacing gold-backed counterparts, and there‚Äôs chatter about national Bitcoin reserves gaining traction.

As more institutions and governments warm up to crypto‚Äôs potential, $BTC keeps charting its path to mainstream recognition. Is this the start of a new financial era?

"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: Bitcoin blasts past $99,000, fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs intriguing statement likening BTC to gold, not the dollar. Speaking at the DealBook Summit, Powell referred to $BTC as a competitor to gold, highlighting its significance as a digital asset while downplaying its role as a traditional currency. 

This is another win for the digital gold narrative. Industry experts have long labeled $BTC as the modern alternative to the shiny yellow metal, and now even the Fed is acknowledging it. Add to that strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs overshadowing gold counterparts, and it‚Äôs clear that BTC‚Äôs dominance is rewriting the rules.

With crypto-savvy leadership potentially on the horizon, could the US be inching toward more crypto-friendly policies? Bitcoin‚Äôs 135% surge this year suggests the markets are already looking ahead. 

Are we witnessing the dawn of Bitcoin replacing gold‚Äôs centuries-old throne? Let‚Äôs hear your thoughts below.

* Do not trust anyone trying to talk with you over DM (Direct or private messages) or on another platform (like Discord or Telegram). This is how scammers prefer to operate. Report suspicious activity like this immediately and do not respond to them.
* Do not post your address, balances, or other personal information.

Does this time remind you of the dot-com era?,"Man, I have to say living through that time in the late 90's where everyone and their grandmother were giving you tech stock advice was a surreal time. I was new to the industry, but it was hitting this fever pitch where hard working everyday folks were moving all of their hard earned life savings into 100% dot com stocks - just dreaming to strike it rich like all their friends. I could only imagine the conversations that followed with their loved ones, when the entire market dropped out from under them. I wanted so much to say ""I told you so"" ... but was honestly too heartbroken for them.

Fast forward to today. Even with Bitcoin/Crypto's use case being very compelling ... I can't help but to get flash backs of the dot-com era. This euphoria has occurred before, and I hate to think that history will repeat itself again (which it more than likely would, as I'm hearing people talk and act the same way).

There's no question these are exciting times, but can't help but to have PTSD ... with visions of people losing the shirt off their backs.

"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: $BTC skyrocketed past $99,000 on Wednesday, igniting the crypto world after Fed Chair Jerome Powell dropped a bombshell comparing Bitcoin to gold. Speaking at the DealBook Summit, Powell emphasized that Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a competitor to the dollar but rather digital gold. With that statement, the crypto king solidified its status as a store of value in the eyes of traditional finance.

This surge comes as Bitcoin ETFs outshine gold ETFs in record time, and pro-crypto political moves from the Trump camp add fuel to the fire. Market dominance, institutional recognition, and a 135% rally this year‚Äî$BTC is cementing its role in reshaping wealth storage globally. 

As Powell distances himself from crypto adoption as a payment method, it‚Äôs hard to ignore Bitcoin‚Äôs growing clout as a safe-haven alternative to traditional assets. The sentiment on the ground? Gold 2.0 is here, and it‚Äôs fully digital!

Ich habe eine einfache Apple Numbers Tabelle f√ºr die vereinfachte Depotdarstellung erstellt.

Ich bin kein Excel/Numbers Profi, jedoch gef√§llt mir die M√∂glichkeit, ein St√ºck weit unabh√§ngiger von diversen Finanz-/Depotauswertungs-Apps zu sein, und ""Alles auf einen Blick"" zu haben.

In meinem Fall hier werden die aktuellen Kursdaten von Numbers direkt von YahooFinance bezogen, die Funktionsm√∂glichkeit d√ºrfte bekannt sein.

In der Tabelle m√ºsst ihr lediglich eure Anpassungen bei Bezeichnung, Anzahl und Kaufkurse vornehmen und im Feld ""Aktuelle Kurse"" mit Doppelklick die richtige Aktie/Asset ausw√§hlen.

Bei Fragen versuche ich gerne zu helfen. Es gibt sicherlich bessere Vorlagen, m√∂chte aber gerne meine √úbersicht hier beisteuern. Vielleicht gef√§llt es ja irgendwem und hilft jemandem weiter.

Hinweis: Funktioniert ausschlie√ülich mit Numbers, aber vielleicht k√∂nnt ihr sie ja konvertieren bei Interesse.

"Bitcoin Crosses $100,000 in Triumphant All-Time Record","üö® Crypto News: The crypto world is officially in euphoria as $BTC smashes past the long-awaited $100,000 milestone. This historic feat has been fueled by a perfect storm of bullish drivers including increasing institutional adoption, a pro-crypto regulatory wave, and record-breaking ETF inflows. 

From trading at just $42,000 earlier this year to now hitting $103,117, Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been nothing short of sensational. With MicroStrategy stacking billions worth of $BTC, crypto ETFs seeing surging demand, and hodlers riding the greed wave, this rally feels unstoppable. 

The optimism surrounding Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto administration and the collaboration between lawmakers and blockchain innovators has created fertile ground for Bitcoin's evolution. Welcome to a new era, where the possibilities for $BTC‚Äîand the entire crypto space‚Äîseem limitless.

2024 is undoubtedly Bitcoin‚Äôs year, and as the crypto community has been saying for years: it was never *if*, but always *when*. Brace yourselves, because this could just be the beginning.

BNB Hits Record High as Altcoin Rally Accelerates,"BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, surged to a lifetime high of $793 on Wednesday, gaining 14% in 24 hours and breaking out of a three-year price range. This rally comes as traders rotate capital from bitcoin into altcoins, benefiting from a friendlier U.S. regulatory outlook following Donald Trump‚Äôs election win.

BNB‚Äôs rise was supported by reduced regulatory pressures on Binance, with founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao resolving legal issues earlier this year. The exchange also strengthened compliance measures and continued its quarterly token burn program, destroying 1.7 million BNB last month.

Increased activity on the BNB Chain, including a rise in daily active addresses and transactions, has further fueled demand for the token. BNB now stands out as one of the biggest gainers in the ongoing altcoin market rotation.",Actual_Ad_5440,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1h72k51/bnb_hits_record_high_as_altcoin_rally_accelerates/,2024-12-05 06:06:54,1,title,0.0,0.045,0.764,0.191,0.9713

Major run for alts,"With btc reaching ATH and blowing past 100k could spark a frenzy of people buying Bitcoin and only time will tell how high it goes. Rightnow alts are stalling while most are funneling money into btc. Continue to watch, once btc starts to retrace profits will enter alt coins. 

With the market hitting 3.6T market cap we are barely above what last bull market topped at which did about 3T. If history repeats or at the very least rhymes we could potentially see trillions more enter the market. And with most alts not even breaking or coming close to their previous ATH we could see a massive run for alts. 

100k bitcoin is gonna spread like wildfire through the media and with btc being already so high FOMO will set in, and not only for btc but for alts. Mix that with people rotating their profits from btc to alts is a perfect storm for price appreciation.

The Future of Tesla,"The biggest pump and dump of all time.¬†

Tesla.

Ask yourself this, why did Bill Gates (as of July 4, 2024) have a $2 Billion short position against one of the most wildly popular meme stocks of all time? I can think a billion better ways to spend that money. That short was meant to make a statement, as it is nearly negligible to Bill‚Äôs Net Worth.

It‚Äôs easy to say that Bill shorted Tesla because it is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 96 during a good economy. And perhaps Bill knows exactly what happens to automakers when the economy suffers, hint‚Ä¶ some go bankrupt - RIP Pontiac.

Or, Bill has realized what many are starting to see. What I see at least.

Elon‚Äôs pay is tied to metrics of Tesla‚Äôs stock capitalization. So, the more the stock rises, the richer Elon becomes.¬†

Now any idiot with half a desire to make another dollar would do whatever necessary to make the price go up, what the wannabe wolfs on wall street call ‚Äúa pump‚Äù

Elon‚Äôs package, which is hard to write with a straight face, is the dump.

So how exactly do we conclude this is a pump and dump, and not a massively successful and brilliant person working around the clock to ensure the success of every venture?

For starters, if we include: Tesla, TwitterX, xAI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Nueralink, and now the Department of Government Efficiency

that‚Äôs seven major organizations that he‚Äôs allegedly devoting time to. If you don‚Äôt factor traveling or sleeping, or basically any function besides working, it averages out at best for each company he is spending 1 day per week.¬†

In all reality, some are getting more attention than others, and he most likely delegates any real work to anybody but himself. So yeah, maybe it‚Äôs possible.

Or perhaps the success of the other companies is so much less serious because simply put, they were just meant to drive up the price of Tesla.

Remember when Tesla bought bitcoin? They bought in January 2021 for a price of $33,000 and sold in July of 2022 for a price of $23,000.¬† And since then, Tesla has rallied whenever Bitcoin rallies, even though Tesla sold for a 30% loss. Or remember the dogg coin pump and dump Elon did via tweets?

By starting all these other companies and ventures, Elon has made people believe in the idea of him. That anything he does is successful. Except, his success, on the backs of other actually brilliant people mind you, is about 3 for 6 with his current engagements. (#7- Department of Government Efficiency can‚Äôt be counted yet because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet)

Tesla - Successful, albeit fraught with troubles from Model 3 production, FSD that‚Äôs always a year away, and the Cybertruck which was such a bad vehicle, from concept to build, that it has it‚Äôs own subreddit dedicated to mocking it.

Twitter/X - Was successful under it‚Äôs deadname, of Twitter, but now it‚Äôs become a well known propaganda machine.

xAI - It‚Äôs so unsuccessful so far I had to ask Gemini about it, and it told me it‚Äôs name is Grok.

SpaceX - Pretty successful venture as far as the goal, maybe not so much the revenue portion, again though, it‚Äôs built by other geniuses. Actual ‚ÄòRocket Scientists‚Äô

However, now it‚Äôs becoming it‚Äôs own traded company in the form of a Tender Offer, so in theory it shouldn‚Äôt have as much association with Tesla.¬†

The Boring Company - Lol @ Las Vegas. Definitely not a success.

Nueralink - Kills monkeys and wants to accomplish the same goal as Twitter/X, which is control peoples thoughts.

In short, all of these side projects were meant to get people talking about Elon, and Tesla in order to drive up the price. It worked. He became the richest man in the world 3 years ago (2021). When Tesla dropped in 2022, I thought people had finally realized that it wasn‚Äôt all it was cracked up to be. But here we are, on the precipice of a wild year that many are already saying will have a major market correction.",one_ugly_monkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h72hvj/the_future_of_tesla/,2024-12-05 06:02:56,2,title,5.0,0.088,0.781,0.131,0.9902

How to Spot the Top of a Bull Market,"
Everyone loves a bull market ‚Äî until the music stops.

Here‚Äôs how to know the top is near (and stay ahead):

1. Follow the Funding

When funding rates spike, everyone‚Äôs leveraged long. That‚Äôs peak greed ‚Äî and it always ends with a reset. Check it on: any exchange or Coinglass

2. Open Interest > Market Cap

When open interest outpaces market cap, speculation is running wild. One shake, and the whole thing collapses. Track it on: Coinalyze.

3. Watch the Whales

Whales cash out at market tops‚Äîwatch for big deposits to exchanges. Smart money always exits first. Spot it on: Whale Alert

4. Liquid Holders Surge

When diamond hands turn into paper hands, it‚Äôs over. Wallet activity spikes, and exits flood in. Find it on: Glassnode to track wallet activity and liquid holder surges.

The Secret:

When these signals align, the top is here.

Bull markets don‚Äôt last forever‚Äîdon‚Äôt just ride the wave. Exit smart.

The next move is yours.

P.S. Right now we are good according to those signals.",NikBit999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h73ktc/how_to_spot_the_top_of_a_bull_market/,2024-12-05 07:14:55,1,title,0.0,0.039,0.758,0.203,0.9853

Will asset prices ever correct?,"We just saw Bitcoin reach $100k. No, this isn't a home, it isn't a stock in a profit generating business, it is literally just limited computer code trading on a market. I don't care about Bitcoin itself, but it is really symptomatic of the entire economy. It seems gains in the economy are purely about increasing the value of assets. There isn't a desire to expand anything. 

The previous two centuries saw expansion combined with competition to not only make life easier, but also to expand human horizons. It was generally a rising tide raises all ships moment (I'm being very general with this phrase, of course there were victims of this expansion). We don't really see that now. There is a collection of monopolies and oligopolies that have cornered the market in various places and any economic determination is guided by them. Of course it is in their best interests to simply artificially limit supply, reduce unprofitability at the expense of human welfare, and lobby for little to no regulation in their areas of commerce.

As a result, most people's lives are becoming harder to merely survive in this society. We live in the reality that subsequent generations will be worse off materially than the previous ones. Theoretically, work hours could have been shorter and less of our income could have been spent on necessities. But instead productivity gains have been fed into the stock market and the financial world as a whole creating bubbles that past generations could not even fathom. 

What is the point of taking an economics class when you are better off trading memestocks or crypto? Having a fundamental understanding of the economy is detrimental at this time. Look at Warren Buffett now with Berkshire-Hathaway sitting on 1/3 of a trillion dollars, imagine if that money had been invested right now. Insane amounts of potential gains not made due to one man's inability to agree that 2+2=5 and that we have a great economy right now worth investing in. 

Sorry if this comes across as a rant, but I have to say it. Nothing makes any sense.",jhtyjjgTYyh7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1h73jv7/will_asset_prices_ever_correct/,2024-12-05 07:13:08,0,title,0.0,0.071,0.774,0.155,0.9894

I got raided,"So back in 2015 I started messing with the DW. I eventually got a package that got stuck in customs. This wasn't a small package and I felt like I had really good opsec, but greed got the best of me. I should've let it stay in the PO box but I had a friend pick it up for me. Then I got the dreaded text to my burner phone... ""Cops""

I went into overdrive mode. I got everything as fucking far away from me as possible. I never kept anything incriminating at my house, but I went around and even got rid of shit that could look suspect if I got that knock.

I knew they were on to me because I told my friend if anything happened I would pay his bail or get him a laywer. He wanted bail so thats what i got him.  When he got out he said they knew my name. So I waited. 

I was on DOC and had to call a number every day. This would say a list of PO names and if mine was read, I would have to see my PO the following day. Within a week of everything going down I finally heard his name and that's when they got me. Alphabet boys came in from all directions. I got interrogated and kept my mouth shut. They tried good cop/bad cop on me (they were pretty damn good at it too, didn't realize until after they did that) and they got a warrent for my house. I didn't know if my buddy ratted me out. They said he did. When the FEDs said that I told them to show me the written statement. They didn't have one and I believed at that time I was calling their bluff. 

As they searched my house my PO searched my car. I got rid of my two burner phones and only had my personal phone in the car.. but assumed I could've said something stupid on it so I refused to unlock it. My PO told me ""If you don't unlock this phone I'll violate you for 30 days, and on the 29th day I'll bring it to you and if you don't unlock it I'll violate you for another 30 days until you do. Your time on supervision freezes and I'll keep you there until you cave"" I told him FUCK YOU TAKE ME TO JAIL. The asshole did just that lol. 

So while in jail I stressed. They put an informant in my cell. He was supposedly on the chain to go to another jail and just passing through. I been to prison and know how the chain works. There was no way he would be sitting in my cell for a week. Let alone two weeks waiting to catch a bus. He was there for basically my whole 30 days. He tried to bond with me, he would always be within ear shot of my conversations. He even asked me about bitcoin after awhile and asked what drugs I've done. I just acted like I had no idea what he was ever talking about and said I've only smoked weed.

So I get out and now have a new PO. The FEDS put a car on my street to watch my house. No one was in it. I know it was the feds because I live on a long one way in, one way out street with only a couple houses on it and I knew the 3 other houses that lived on it. No one knew who the car belonged to, but it was gone within a week. 

I kept my head low and got a normal 9-5. I put 5k of  dirty money they never found and became a truck driver. I lived in fear that one day they would come back and get me because the statute of limitations is 5 years. 

Well guys. 5 years later I got some mail. It was from my county saying I had items in storage I could come pick up or it would be destroyed. A cellphone, USB sticks, iPad and some other random shit. I let them keep it.

Now I have been in the free and clear for awhile, ask me anything. Or I can go into greater detail about my story, cuz some wild (and funny) shit happened that month lol",Contract_Expired,https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1h73jno/i_got_raided/,2024-12-05 07:12:43,5,title,1.0,0.144,0.784,0.072,-0.9969

CryptoQuant Highlights 2024 as the Year of Bitcoin‚Äôs Institutional Breakthrough,"üö® Crypto News: 2024 is officially the year institutions went full-on Bitcoin, and the numbers don't lie! With the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, the corporate cash flow into $BTC has been nothing short of revolutionary. Bitcoin‚Äôs realized cap surged by a staggering $300 billion, jumping from $430B to $730B in less than 12 months. 

BlackRock? They alone are sitting on a treasure chest worth over $500M in Bitcoin, and heavy hitters like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital have been loading their bags too. MicroStrategy more than doubled its holdings to 402K BTC, while Marathon dropped $700M on fresh Bitcoin buys. The ripple effect? Improved liquidity and an unmistakable stamp of credibility on Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

But not all glitter is gold. Analysts highlight that while institutions dominated the headlines, Bitcoin‚Äôs tech side has largely stayed under the radar. Even innovative protocols like Runes found it tough to steal the spotlight, despite some tokens hitting near $1B caps.

As ETFs turn Bitcoin into prime-time finance, there's rising speculation about ""de-decentralization"" concerns. While the institutions played lead this year, the crypto community is left wondering: Is this growth veering from decentralization‚Äôs core ethos?

This technology is no longer an esoteric interest in cryptocurrency circles, as it has been for quite a long time. Recent momentum has been related to adoption and application in real life, especially regarding day-to-day situations and verticals.

But blockchain reinvents how we share, store information, and verify everything, even as important as origin, other than financial transaction records. Whether you can imagine being able to trace where your food is coming from, verify the authenticity of a luxury item, or securely vote in an election, thank this thing called blockchain. 

This means that all those are realities because blockchain has made supply chains completely transparent, safeguarded intellectual property with NFT and smart contracts, and driven innovative healthcare with secure data sharing.

Instead, it supplants old intermediaries with immutable ledgers and global consensus algorithms, drastically reducing costs, massively amplifying security, and offering an unprecedented level of transparency to businesses and consumers alike. It enables people to alter the fabric of trust into a whole new model of accountability and efficiency.

Equally captivating, however, is how blockchain has actually managed to change the core of how creative industries work by giving artists and creators the power to protect their work and receive rightful remunerations. 

This is a revolution in DeFi, providing financial tools to underserved communities; it is a reimagining of governance via decentralized autonomous organizations. These innovations unlock creative potential and redistribute power in ways unimaginable earlier.

This has been a constant change in perspective as blockchain technology has been extended to solve scalability, energy efficiency, and security barriers that have been driving mainstream adoption. 

This work integrates new consensus mechanisms, hence the modern blockchain platforms against emergent threats that are future-proof via advanced cryptography. The theory and actuality gap regarding the practical possibilities of blockchain is closed. 

This, in turn, allows developers to build scalable and secure decentralized applications. At the same time, users will interact seamlessly within the Web3 ecosystem, from token trades to asset staking and contributions to sustainable projects. 

Needless to say, blockchain is way more than just a technological innovation; it enables an inclusive, green, and transformative digital future. It shall be up-front in return to that wake-the-true era for blockchain: sustainable, accessible, and future-proof secure, whereas NCOG barely keeps pace in order to set the very high bar as to how blockchain technology really could cause a tidal wave of change in our world.

It's not some vision anymore; it's real. Blockchain changes the way industries work and empowers a person, rebuilding an even fairer digital space. In this case, blockchain, which is unleashed by such platforms as the NCOG Earth Chain, makes the possibility unstoppable: it's a revolutionary force that's taking the world to new dimensions.

"Greed, loss and regret.","
In 2021, I found a promising DeFi project. I invested around $6,000, and after just a couple of months, I had $1 million in unrealized profit. I couldn‚Äôt sell all of it because the tokens were locked and would only unlock slowly over the next year. However, they were transferable, so I could sell them to someone at about a quarter or half of their price. I had around 30,000‚Äì40,000 locked tokens and about 5,000‚Äì8,000 unlocked tokens. The peak price of the token was around $25.

I got greedy. Instead of selling, I actually bought more locked tokens. I also invested the rest in NFTs. The project eventually died out, and I was forced to sell all my tokens for about $5,000, and invested it all in NFTs which I eventually lost too. I was new to crypto and hadn‚Äôt experienced what they call ‚Äúthe winter season.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think about buying and holding Bitcoin or Ethereum, or cashing out some to put in my bank account. I was stupid. I thought the price would continue to rise. I felt like I was on top of the world and that nothing else mattered at the time. I still regret my decisions to this day.

I took a break in 2022 and only came back earlier this year. I started with $500 and earned $20,000 from memecoins. I cashed out $10,000 (when Solana was around $120) out of fear of losing it all again. I used that money to buy a small property. The rest I gambled on more memecoins and lost. I now have only $3,000 left, and I feel like a huge stupid fuck for messing it all up. I wish I bought at least one bitcoin at 30K. The regrets are killing me inside everyday.

Bitcoin price surges as the chairman of the FED effectively confirms there will be no strategic bitcoin reserve. ,"Cannot be too hard on the crypto-bros as they don't have the full quote but I'm pretty sure Powell's statement yesterday is him confirming that the FED will not be buying any Bitcoin as long as he is chairman. 

He emphasised the need for stability and called bitcoin highly volatile.   
How else could you interpret this ? 

Trump could replace him but doesn't seem inclined to.

Am I missing something or is this part of the pump powered by the disproving of the previous part of the pump ? ",Ok_Confusion_4746,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1h79yfn/bitcoin_price_surges_as_the_chairman_of_the_fed/,2024-12-05 14:07:32,1,title,0.0,0.07,0.768,0.162,0.8914

"Great job, don't download random apps, scammers are everywhere. 


Anyway, we all have been where you're at, read and bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick and read this short guide, please:

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin.


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

12/5/2024 Daily Plays Rolling the dice on bear ETF TSLA MSTR SMST and TSLZ small bets! SAIC good report 1.2 billion buyback?? Added! ACMR ZIM ASPN STX bidding on EVER MAX PRAA lots of SNOW in CT! Only slush in NYC will be taking care of that! Unfortunately,"Good morning everyone. The briefing will be shorter today than usual. I started getting calls and texts around 6:30AM about the snow in CT. It is slush here in NYC. But 6+ inches and still snowing at my rental properties. They are about 110 to 125 miles away, in all neighboring towns. The only one that people may have heard of is Bristol CT. This is because ESPN base is right by 4 of my properties. Im going back and forth with about 5 tenants since this morning, and 2 of my contractors/snow crew. Everyone wants their snow done first, but I have 2 crews and 20 properties, it doesn‚Äôt work like that! I apologize that you need to go to work!

¬†

Man, the other day after a miss on earnings newly added CLSK \[Bitcoin play\] crashed to 12.60. I had an order for shares at 12.50. I didn‚Äôt like the options on it. The premiums were high, probably because people knew that this would rise again and quickly. People like to call this IV. They are trying to sound smart and technical, confuse people‚Ä¶ basically, very volatile. For instance:

The stock was 12.60, and I was looking for January 17^(th) calls \[6 weeks because I don‚Äôt gamble\] with a 15 strike‚Ä¶ This was 2.40 away from current stock price. I had hoped to make this bet, that it would hit within 6 weeks, a 15 stock price, and would bet maybe 1 to 1.25 in order to get this option. Instead, the Call was about 2 dollars! I am not paying 2 dollars for an option that will yield me 40 extra cents! So instead I made a small bet on calls. Bitcoin is too volatile, so, I didn‚Äôt want to get more than 250 shares. But it didn‚Äôt fill. Back in 2021, I was buying 2-4,000 share blocks of companies‚Ä¶ I had about 20,000 shares of LL \[Now Defunct but back then making money\] and the stock was 20! \[400K\] There wasn‚Äôt much risk back then! I was trading blocks of 2-4,000 for 25 cents, netting 500-1,000 per trade! 2021 was amazing! I did show some screen shots back in 2021, here at Ultimatetraders. I wouldn‚Äôt buy or sell it at the moment, CLSK, but if you check a couple of days ago, I said I want that dip! I don‚Äôt like most of the Bitcoin players, they don‚Äôt grow and don‚Äôt make money‚Ä¶. CLSK doesn‚Äôt make money, but the growth is amazing!

¬†

I will dice roll on MSTR bear shares SMST. I did a couple of trades 2 weeks ago. Small bets! 500 shares or about 2,000 bucks. \[I do not want puts, as they run out of time until the market shows me downside conviction, when done, it will definitely come! I do not know when, probably some bad news, but 100%, but I do not want to get in early\] Until then I will make small bets on bear ETFs. The TSLA bear TSLZ. I did not trade this yet.

¬†

SAIC had fairly good earnings. They are engineers. I have not done DD on this in years.. I added it to plays on their 1.2 billion buyback!!!! This only! I HAVE NOT DONE NEW DD! This 1.2 billion represents 20% of the company! They have been around 20+ years‚Ä¶ I will do the DD later but for now, I will still check calls and shares. As we know the stock market is a live auction. When you have a company with cash, financials to support this buyback!! They will alter the auctions! Extreme demand on the buy side‚Ä¶ buying shares will pull away shares from the sell side, and retire them! I need to do the DD on the financials but I will take the risk‚Ä¶

¬†

I have to take care of CT now, I am getting more calls!

5 Trade Ideas:

STX ACMR ZIM ASPN ‚Äì I have been trading these horses, I am in 100 STX at 96.75, ZIM 250 at 19.50 and ASPN 250 at 14.25‚Ä¶ I hope to sell these for 200+? I sold ACMR for 1.25 yesterday from 15.50 to 16.75

¬†

SAIC ‚Äì Engineers, decent earnings, need new DD especially financials, but 1.2 billion buyback got me! That is 20% of the company!

¬†

EVER PRAA ‚Äì These are 2 companies that had very good earnings, stocks took off and have dipped back down, I will buy the dip on companies executing

¬†

MAX ‚Äì They were fined big by the Govt, and they are a lead generator for insurance, in the 11s I have been taking the risk, without the fine, it‚Äôs a good company, not great but good, but this dropped from near 18 to 11 on the news a few weeks ago

¬†

SMST TSLZ ‚Äì Bear TSLA and MSTR small bets

Everyone Keeps Saying No One Really Knowsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,"Not sure why a lot of you are so bearish on the price predictions and keep saying no one really knows. 

I been shouting Bitcoin at 27k last year and everyone kept telling me no one really knows. Now we at 100k, 1 year later. I did know because I been in crypto for a long time. 

Everyone said last year Solona would die now we here at 245$ making new highs soon. 

The Bonk Guy was right. You guys needs to re-evaluate your predictions because it‚Äôs not high enough. We are in a BULL MARKET. If you look at the all previous halvings and look at the price of 1 year after the halving it‚Äôs consistently high few X‚Äôs higher. We have a lot of room to go up. 

Bonk market cap is currently around 3B. If you want to be conservative, 30B is peak minimum. It‚Äôs common sense. Bonk started the whole meme coin wave on Solona. It‚Äôs a blue chip meme. There‚Äôs a lot of room to go. And I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised if we go close to 80-100B next year. Also Donald Trump himself just said Congratulations to everyone on 100k Bitcoin on his X account. So you not bullish enough.

"Nuevos cedears: Ethereum (ETHA), bitcoin (IBIT), Short S&P 500 (SH) y oro f√≠sico (GLD)","  
**Buenos Aires, diciembre de 2024.**¬†BYMA, Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos, y Banco Comafi incorporan al Mercado de Capitales argentino nuevos CEDEARs de ETF, brindando a los inversores m√°s alternativas para transformar sus ahorros en inversiones.

Pr√≥ximamente se podr√° negociar en BYMA el primer ETF disponible en el mercado argentino de:¬† Ethereum (ETHA); bitcoin (IBIT); inverso del √≠ndice Short S&P 500 (SH) y oro f√≠sico (GLD). Junto con el CEDEAR de ETF FXI, que busca replicar un √≠ndice compuesto por las 50 empresas m√°s grandes de China. La emisora de ETHA, GLD y SH es Caja de Valores, depositaria de Grupo BYMA, mientras que Banco Comafi ser√° emisora de IBIT y de FXI.

Los CEDEARs de ETF permiten a los inversores obtener una gran diversificaci√≥n comprando un s√≥lo instrumento y accediendo a los m√∫ltiples activos que lo componen, lo que favorece la reducci√≥n del riesgo. En este sentido, algunos ETF invierten metodol√≥gicamente en una cartera amplia de instrumentos, otorgando amplia exposici√≥n a diferentes regiones, sectores y segmentos.

Asimismo, estos instrumentos poseen una gran liquidez en sus mercados de origen, lo que hace posible que los inversores puedan comprar o vender con facilidad los CEDEARs en cualquier momento de la sesi√≥n de negociaci√≥n.

Con estas incorporaciones, alcanza 14 el total de CEDEARs de ETF disponibles para negociar en BYMA.¬†

**¬øCu√°les son los nuevos CEDEARs de ETF?**

**#1¬†ETHA**¬†es un fondo de inversi√≥n que busca replicar el valor de Ethereum, permite obtener exposici√≥n a esta criptomoneda sin la necesidad de adquirirla directamente. Las ventajas de los ETF es que se adquieren y almacenan igual que el resto de activos tradicionales, por lo que no es necesario utilizar billeteras y claves privadas para resguardar estos instrumentos. Ratio 5:1

**#2 IBIT**¬†es un fondo de inversi√≥n que busca replicar el valor del bitcoin, sin necesidad de adquirir la criptomoneda. Ratio 10:1

ETHA e IBIT son la primera interacci√≥n entre el mundo burs√°til argentino y el de las criptomonedas. Adem√°s, invertir en el ETF implica operar bajo un mercado regulado, lo cual los vuelve m√°s atractivos frente a la inversi√≥n en la criptomoneda.

**#3 GLD**¬†es un fondo de inversi√≥n dise√±ado para seguir de cerca el precio del oro f√≠sico. Es el primer CEDEAR de ETF de metales, permitiendo invertir en uno de los activos m√°s tradicionales del mundo y beneficiarse de las potenciales apreciaciones de este metal. Ratio 50:1

**#4 SH**¬†es el primer CEDEAR de un ETF inverso. Es un fondo dise√±ado para proteger las carteras en tiempos de baja de mercado. Busca replicar a la inversa el rendimiento diario del √çndice Short S&P 500, lo que significa que cuando el precio del ETF sube, la tendencia del √≠ndice es la baja. Es un instrumento para quienes buscan cubrirse contra posibles p√©rdidas en el mercado. Ratio 8:1

**#5 FXI**¬†permite a los inversores obtener exposici√≥n al mercado chino. Busca replicar un √≠ndice compuesto por las 50 empresas m√°s grandes de China. Ratio 5:1

**SOBRE LOS CEDEARS DE ETF**

* En ingl√©s: Exchange Traded Fund, son fondos de inversi√≥n que cotizan en los mercados. Se componen de una canasta de instrumentos y generalmente replican √≠ndices u otros activos (sectores, regiones, monedas, commodities, etc.).

"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Compares Bitcoin to Gold as BTC Surges to $99,000","üö® Crypto News: Bitcoin smashes past $99,000, fueled by none other than Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs latest statements treating BTC as a rival to gold. Powell, speaking at the NYT DealBook Summit, made waves by aligning Bitcoin with the timeless allure of gold rather than seeing it as a budding global currency. This marks a pivotal acknowledgment from traditional finance.

While Powell maintained that BTC is not a competitor for the dollar due to its volatility, his nod to Bitcoin being ""digital gold"" echoed the long-held belief of crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors alike. Bitcoin ETFs in the US are already outpacing gold funds, further solidifying BTC‚Äôs role as a dominant store of value.  

The timing couldn‚Äôt be better‚Äîalongside these comments, Bitcoin's rally this year hit an eye-popping 135%, cementing its place at the top of the investor wish list. Discussions of a national Bitcoin reserve by policymakers and the buzz around the Trump administration‚Äôs crypto-friendly stance only add fuel to the fire.  

As institutional adoption accelerates and government leaders begin to grasp Bitcoin‚Äôs transformative promise, the digital gold narrative feels more alive than ever.

No. Because you're offsetting one or two big hits with mediocre growth.

How Political/Religious Beliefs Can Crush the Fanatical Investor,"Independent thought is one of the most basic, yet illusive skillsets a successful investor must develop if he/she is going to have any hope of consistently outperforming the market. And if you think about it, being able to outperform any given benchmark, automatically means that you must think differently than the crowd.

In journalism, thinking like a contrarian is an everyday part of the job. You‚Äôre trained to be objective and open-minded while you follow the facts.

For example, one of the coolest opportunities I had in the field was following a number of federal biologists on fish surveys throughout the Tennessee Valley, which by the way, is home to the most biodiverse temperate river system in the world‚Äîthe Duck River. And what struck me as odd is the systematic way these scientists conducted each annual sample.

First, they physically measured off 100 meters by stretching a piece of rope alongside the riverbank. The rope was put in the same place every year, and it held flags marking 10-meter sections of the stream. Then, they surveyed each section by pulling a sein net while others on the team wore Ghostbuster packs and stunned the fish with a temporary electrical shock. All the fish, darters, and minnows were collected, counted, then released safely back into the stream once all 100 meters of data was logged into a public archive, which state and federal conservation officials continually monitor for overall stream health.

Because minnows and darters are some of the most ecologically sensitive animals in a stream, any gradual change in fish density is a way to identify potential threats to the public‚Äôs drinking-water supply. If biologists see something strange, state and federal officials work together to identify and mitigate any water-quality issues long before they have a chance to escalate to the point of impacting public health.

The fish literally serve as canaries in an aquatic ‚Äúcoal mine.‚Äù And the University of Tennessee actually has a library of pickled fish dating back to the early 1960s, which allows scientists to study the impacts of microplastic pollution, hybridization, and all sorts of things. ¬†

But what I find odd, is this experience actually helped me become a better investor, because I quickly realized why the scientific method truly works. It‚Äôs a standardized collection of data that is void of any human bias, emotion, or algorithmic formula, which often dictates how we process information.

**Controlling Biased Inputs**

True journalism is supposed to work like the scientific method, but did you know that all your major cable news networks only broadcast ‚Äúnews‚Äù in the middle of the day? Have you noticed that EVERYTHING beyond the 5 o‚Äôclock hour is opinion? Or what about the echo chambers of social media, which automatically feed users more and more of the content that makes them stop scrolling?

If these fun facts sound foreign, or you‚Äôre not sure how everyday source inputs of ‚Äúopinion‚Äù could possibly influence your investment decisions in the stock market, then you‚Äôre probably going through life‚Äîas Charlie Munger once said‚Äîlike a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.

Every person on Planet Earth is born with a basic human tendency to only consume information that confirms their personal opinions, values, and beliefs. And by knowing the existence of this fatal flaw, the intelligent investor will always guard against it, which is so much easier when we choose to take agency over our own lives. And this begins by making the intentional decision to control the inputs that are constantly bombarding our subconscious.

¬†

**How Religion/Politics Can Influence the Fanatic Investor**

For example, because we‚Äôve got such a diverse group, here‚Äôs a real-life illustration that most of you will probably find bizarre or even funny‚Äîbut only if you haven‚Äôt personally experienced the culture from which this everyday phobia is fostered.

What if I allowed common Bible Belt theology to influence my investment decisions? What if I viewed conflict in the Middle East as some fulfillment of end-times prophecy and a reason to stay in government bonds for the next 40 years? Would my decision not to build wealth for the rest of my existence, by choosing to position my portfolio for a once-in-a-multi-billion-year apocalypse, be any more rational than the paranoid pastor who decided to sell all his bitcoin‚Äîor anything else that could be seen as a ‚Äúsingle world currency‚Äù‚Äîafter seeing an eerie-looking pale horse ride down the Rhine River at the 2024 Olympics?

Sure, most people aren‚Äôt governed by these fanatical fears, but how many people did in fact position themselves defensively in 2024 because of politics? How many people deliberately chose to miss out on a historic bull market because of a low-probability chance of civil war or the end of American democracy? Should there really have been $7T sitting in risk-free money-market funds at the same time the Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates, which the objective investor automatically recognized as a bullish greenlight for the stock market?

**How the Sausage is Made in the Media**

To illustrate the point, now that everyone‚Äôs emotions should be relatively cool, let‚Äôs look back at how one single event was ‚Äúspun‚Äù by three different news networks‚Äîthe October 2024 jobs report.

According to the report, the U.S. economy added only 12,000 jobs in the month of October. This missed the projected consensus by more than 100,000 jobs, and was well off the mark from the August and September jobs report, which after revisions, showed about 125,000 new jobs created in each of those two months.

On CNBC, which is as close to an unbiased network as you can get, these numbers were televised without a political slant. The network reported that the extreme drop in new jobs was largely due to two historic hurricanes that rocked Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. The low jobs number was viewed as a bullish sign for stocks, because it meant that the data-dependent Fed could proceed with interest-rate cuts because of further evidence of a cooling economy. The jobs data reinforced the long-held view on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve was nearing a so-called ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù or ‚ÄúSoft Landing‚Äù scenario, which meant they were likely to tame inflation without causing a feared economic recession.

On Fox News, the nightly opinion hosts never mentioned any of the caveats surrounding the October hurricanes, or the overall objective of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Fox reported the 12,000-job number was undeniable proof that the economy sucked and ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù was to blame.

On CNN, the nightly opinion hosts boasted about the stock market‚Äôs all-time highs, ignored the jobs number, then doubled down about how rosy everything was on Main Street because ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù had conquered inflation. What they failed to mention, was the fact that although inflation was indeed cooling, grocery prices were still up more than 30% since the supply-chain shocks of a global pandemic, and the average American household had lost 1/3 of their purchasing power.

This is why I try to avoid fanatical viewpoints and Media outlets like the plague. The same is true with social media, because even if a biased network serves as everyday background noise, it can still impact the way a person views the world. The same is true with your circle of friends, coworkers, and the people with whom you associate.

Rule of thumb, if you allow fanatical viewpoints to influence your investment decisions, just expect to pay a heavy penalty for ignoring objective data. Investing is as much about human psychology and adhering to a specific investment process as it is managing risks. If you want to be a better investor, work hard to take the emotional aspect out of your trades, and remember to think like a scientist. Let the data steer your decisions, not the opinion or the subjectivity of a biased newsfeed.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #8 (endorsements?)

""**[Big Company/Banana Republic/Politician] is exploring/using bitcoin/blockchain!  Now will you admit you were wrong?**"" / ""**Crypto has 'UsE cAs3S!'**"" / ""**EEE TEE EFFs!!one**""

 1.  The original claim was that crypto was ""disruptive technology"" and was going to ""replace the banking/finance system"".  There were all these claims suggesting blockchain has tremendous ""potential"".  Now with [the truth slowly surfacing regarding blockchain's inability to be particularly good at anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA), crypto people have backpedaled to instead suggest, ""Hey it has 'use-cases'!""   

 Congrats!  You found somebody willing to use crypto/blockchain technology.  That still is not an endorsement of crypto or blockchain.  I can choose to use a pair of scissors to cut my grass.  This doesn't mean scissors are ""the future of lawn care technology.""  It just means I'm an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available.  

 The operative issue isn't whether crypto & blockchain can be ""used"" here-or-there.  The issue is: *Is there a good reason?  Does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using?*  And the answer to that is, [No.](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/)

 2.  Most of the time, adoption claims are outright wrong. Just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government, corporation or other entity is embracing crypto.  It usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said, ""We'll look into it"" and that got interpreted as ""adoption imminent!""
 3.  In cases where companies did launch crypto/blockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories:
  * Some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some ""crypto project"" involving a well known entity that never got off the ground, or was tried and failed miserably (such as [IBM/Maersk's Tradelens](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens), [Australia's stock exchange](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/), etc.)  See also [dead blockchain projects](https://weh.wtf/34-blockchain-projects.html).
  * Companies (like VISA, Fidelity or Robin Hood) **are not embracing crypto directly**.  Instead they are *partnering with a crypto exchange* (such as BitPay) that will either handle all the crypto transactions and they're merely licensing their network, or they're a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat.  There's no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto, or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto.  It's a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws.
  * What some companies are calling ""blockchain"" is not in any meaningful way actually using 'blockchain' tech. For example, IBM's ""Hyperledger"" claims to have ""[blockchain design philosophy](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/Hyperledger/Offers/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf)"" but in reality, it is not decentralized and has no core architecture that's anything like crypto blockchain systems. Also note that IBM has their own trademarked phrase, ""IBM Blockchain¬Æ"" - their version of ""blockchain"" is neither decentralized, nor permissionless. It does not in any way resemble a crypto blockchain. It also remains to be seen, the degree to which anybody is actually using their ""IBM Food Trust"" supply chain tracking system, which we've [proven cannot really benefit from blockchain technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2108s).
  
 4.  Sometimes, politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve -- [this almost always fails](https://truthout.org/articles/miamis-mayor-went-all-in-on-cryptocurrency-his-constituents-suffered/), but again, crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal, while ignoring any follow-up materials that say such a proposal was rejected.

 5.  Just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesn't mean, ""It's the future.""

  McDonald's bundled [Beanie Babies](https://i.imgur.com/McdwlxA.jpg) with their Happy Meals for a time, when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme.  Corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money, and the moment these fads fade, they drop any association and pretend it never happened.  This has already occurred with many tech companies from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/), to [a major consortium of European corporations who pulled the plug on their blockchain projects](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/major-insurers-pull-the-plug-on-b3i-insurance-blockchain-consortium/).  Even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago, proponents still hype the projects as if they're still active.


 6. Crypto ETFs are not an endorsement of crypto. (In fact part of the US SEC [was vehemently against approving ETFs - it was not a unanimous decision](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023))  They're simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts.  These entities do not care at all about the future of crypto.  It's just a way for them to make more money with fees, and just like in #4, the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme, they'll drop it.  It's simply businesses taking advantage of a fad.  Crypto ETFs though are actually worse, because they're a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market -- if crypto was a viable *alternative* to TradFi, then these gimmicky things wouldn't be desirable.

 7. Countries like El Salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really haven't in any meaningful way.  El Salvador's endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own non-transparent software, ""Chivo"" that is not on bitcoin's main blockchain - and as such isn't really bitcoin adoption as much as it's bitcoin exploitation.  Plus, USD is the real legal tender in El Salvador and since BTC's adoption, use of crypto has stagnated.  In two years, the country's investment in BTC has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account.  Also note [Venezuela has now scrapped its state-sanctioned cryptocurrency](https://www.foreignbrief.com/venezuela-to-scrap-state-cryptocurrency/)

So, whenever you hear ""so-and-so company is using crypto"" always be suspect.  What you'll find is either that's not totally true, or if they are, they're partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association, not unlike an advertiser/licensing relationship.   **Not** adoption.  Exploitation.   And temporary at that.

We've seen absolutely no increase in crypto adoption - in fact quite the contrary.  More and more people in every industry from [gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust) to [banking](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-federal-reserve-rejects-crypto-focused-banks-application-be-supervised-by-2023-01-27/), are rejecting deals with crypto companies.",,AmericanScream,/r/Buttcoin/comments/1h7dmta/newbie_question/m0k9r5c/,2024-12-05 16:50:46,1,comment,,0.073,0.849,0.077,0.8501

"A Ponzi scheme is defined as ""An investment scam that pays early investors with money taken from later investors to create an illusion of big profits."" In a ponzi-scheme, there is ""nothing of value"" in the box, and all that happens is money moving hands. 

MicroStrategy is not a Ponzi scheme. Companies raise capital through ATM-offerings, debt, and other instruments to fund purchases of assets, equipment, commodities and so forth. This is normal. Berkshire Hathaway similarly built the foundation of their company using debt to buy assets to hold indefinitely.

MicroStrategy invests the money raised in Bitcoin from a core belief that the commodity is in its early stages and will increase significantly in value over the coming years, allowing them to capitalise on this value to create value for their shareholders. All stocks, including blue-chip stocks like Apple, NVIDIA, and Berkshire Hathaway, rely on future investors willing to ""take the shares off your hands"" at a value above what you paid for it. This does not indicate a ""ponzi"" or ""pyramid"" scheme; it's basic price/supply/demand/market dynamics at play, and is how the world economy and capital markets work.

What Makes Ergo So Interesting?,"**I know a lot of folks jumped into Ergo at its peak hype and might still be feeling that sting. But here‚Äôs the thing: while market sentiment swings, Ergo‚Äôs core fundamentals remain rock-solid.** 

**If you‚Äôve been on the fence, now might be the perfect moment to give it another look.**

**Why Ergo Deserves Your Attention:**

**1. Extended UTXO (eUTXO) Model**  
Unlike Ethereum‚Äôs account-based system, Ergo builds on Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model and enhances it. This approach lets developers tie complex smart contracts directly to outputs, making DeFi more predictable, secure, and elegant.

**2. Privacy-Preserving Sigma Protocols**  
With Sigma protocols, you can prove you meet certain conditions without revealing sensitive data. This level of privacy is a massive win for ‚Äútrustless but not intrusive‚Äù DeFi solutions.

**3. Sustainable Economics via Storage Rent**  
Sure, block rewards taper off over time, just like in Bitcoin, but Ergo has a plan for the long haul: storage rent. Idle funds pay a tiny fee, ensuring miners remain incentivized long after the initial emission ends. It‚Äôs a forward-thinking tweak that safeguards the network‚Äôs future.

**4. GPU-Only Mining**  
Ergo‚Äôs Autolykos algorithm is deliberately designed to resist ASIC dominance. By requiring memory-hard operations, it keeps mining accessible to everyday GPU miners. Decentralization isn‚Äôt just a buzzword here; it‚Äôs baked right into the consensus layer.

**5. Faster Confirmations with Subblocks**  
As of August 2023, improvements like UTXO set snapshots and NiPoPoWs have paved the way for subblocks: block candidates with lower difficulty that can appear every second. Expect confirmations in about 20 seconds, making Ergo feel more responsive and user-friendly.

**6. Interoperability Already in Action**  
Rosen Bridge isn‚Äôt just a concept; it‚Äôs already connecting Ergo with Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their respective tokens. Next up are Binance Chain, Dogecoin, and more. Imagine cross-chain DeFi where tokens and liquidity flow seamlessly between major ecosystems, supercharging the possibilities for traders, builders, and everyday users.

**7. The Lithos Protocol for Decentralized Mining Pools**  
Decentralized mining pools have long faced hurdles/security concerns, low miner adoption, inefficiency, but LITHOS aims to change that. Leveraging Stratum as a networking layer, LITHOS is blockchain-agnostic and focuses on fully on-chain, trustless pools. 

It aims to reignite innovation in mining pool infrastructure, bringing efficiency, trustlessness, and a host of miner benefits. It‚Äôs one more arrow in Ergo‚Äôs quiver, showing the platform‚Äôs commitment to a decentralized, fair, and open ecosystem.

**8. A Research-Driven, Future-Focused Approach**  
Ergo‚Äôs team and community place a strong emphasis on academic rigor and careful testing. They‚Äôre not about pumping out flashy features without thinking them through. Instead, Ergo‚Äôs innovations whether it‚Äôs eUTXO, subblocks, or advanced privacy tech, are vetted thoroughly before going live.

**9. A Growing Ecosystem & Active Community**  
From algorithmic stablecoins like AgeUSD and gold-backed stablecoins to lending protocols, NFTs, and beyond, Ergo‚Äôs ecosystem is steadily expanding. It‚Äôs not just one or two dApps making noise; it‚Äôs a whole suite of projects gaining traction. Plus, it‚Äôs backed by an incredibly active and passionate community that supports developers, educates newcomers, and drives adoption.

**TL;DR**: If you got in at the top and felt burned, take heart. The fundamentals that made Ergo exciting in the first place haven‚Äôt gone away, they‚Äôve only gotten stronger. With GPU-friendly mining, improved scalability through subblocks, privacy enhancements, cross-chain connectivity, and the Lithos protocol pushing decentralized mining pools forward, Ergo‚Äôs quietly doing what so many projects only talk about: building a sustainable, interoperable, and user-focused blockchain for the long term. It might just be worth giving it another chance.",supergeometry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h7iva8/what_makes_ergo_so_interesting/,2024-12-05 20:25:28,0,title,3.0,0.035,0.751,0.214,0.999

"[New victims, please read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/ybxjo6/attention_new_victims/)

As a rule of thumb: If you're doubting whether the site is a scam, it probably is.

**No legit company/trader/investor is using WhatsApp. No legit company/trader/investor is approaching people on dating websites or through a ""random"" text message.**

No legit company/trader/investor has ""professors"", ""assistants"", or ""teachers"". Those are just scammers.

No legit company forces you to pay a ""fee"" or ""taxes"" to withdraw money. That's just a scam to suck more money out of you.

You will need to contact law enforcement ASAP.

Unfortunately, no hacker online can get back what you've lost. Please watch out for recovery scams, a follow-up scam done after victims have fallen for an earlier scam. Recently, there has been a rise in scammers DMing members of the subreddit to offer recovery services. A form of the advance-fee, victims are convinced that the scammer can recover their money. This ""help"" can come in the form of fake hacking services or authorities.

Has there ever in the history of the world been a currency that appreciates over the long term? ,"Buttcoiners have long espoused two sets of virtues that bitcoin has that supposedly gives it value.  The first are technical, p2p, trustless, blockchain, etc.  to me these are solutions in search of a problem, interesting, innovative even but ultimately not very useful.  All of those problems have tradfi solutions that seem to work fine.  The second set is its economic properties, namely that it is deflationary and cannot be inflated regardless of the circumstances.  They tout this a huge and obvious benefit.  This leads me to the question:  If this is so good, how come every/any other currency is not deflationary.  There is no technical reason that any government that wants to could make its currency more valuable by simply removing some from circulation, or just maintain its volume while growing GDP.  Do you know of any (historical or current) currency that was purposely deflated and that this policy was maintained for a significant period of time (decades)?  If not has anybody come across a buttcoiners rational why this would work out for buttcoin when it has not worked out for any other currency?

Drone incursion - reality check,"For anyone watching the Ukraine conflict, it is completely beyond fought with drones. Hovering Drones can't fly over oceans, but they can have extraordinary time in the air, counter and active EW, fibre optic coms and power, and active denial capabilities. 

All of these capabilities have already been shown in a Ukraine. 

America has launched long range missiles into Russia. 

They might have ""given them to Ukraine"" but it's no secret such a technical system would require Operators who really knew the system
*ahem, America*

America and the NATO West have made enemies EVERYWHERE. It's a time of real insecurity in the US. 

Drones are super cheap and super effective. Especially in America and The West.

Every country or cause with a grudge against America now has the tools and technology to build the most insane weapons. 

If you're really smart, you've snuck around sanctions and built your systems in America, using access to the best American tech.

You don't also don't need billions to cross oceans with warships with your weapons anymore. 

Just have enough cash from a 2012 bitcoin buy to build a personal drone army with Temu import electronics.

You don't need to invent or import sanctioned stuff, with a good Trust structure they can all be made in America. 

This can all be deniable penetration testing. There's also a whiff of a psyop about whole thing, too.

KULR is the Future: Strategic Bitcoin Play Could Make This Penny Stock a Multi-Bagger ,"Alright, /r/pennystocks, let‚Äôs get serious for a second. I know we all love a good moonshot, but hear me out on why $KULR isn‚Äôt just another penny stock‚Äîit‚Äôs a sleeping giant.

So, KULR just announced they‚Äôre taking their excess treasury cash and putting it into Bitcoin. Naturally, people are out here talking trash, saying things like, ‚ÄúSpeculative penny stock dipping into another speculative asset? Big risk!‚Äù To that, I say: Exactly. This isn‚Äôt a reckless gamble‚Äîit‚Äôs a brilliant strategy for exponential growth.

Here‚Äôs why:
1Ô∏è‚É£ BTC as a Strategic Reserve
We‚Äôve already seen big players like MicroStrategy and Tesla add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Why? Because it‚Äôs an asymmetric bet on long-term value. For a company like $KULR with cutting-edge tech in thermal energy management and battery safety, this move signals they‚Äôre not just trying to survive‚Äîthey‚Äôre playing offense.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Insane Risk/Reward
Let‚Äôs be real, we‚Äôre not buying penny stocks for their blue-chip stability. We‚Äôre here for moonshots. The combo of KULR‚Äôs strong business fundamentals and a BTC kicker could supercharge the stock. The downside is limited (it‚Äôs a penny stock anyway), but the upside? A potential market cap of $5B or more. That‚Äôs a minimum target IMO.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ignore the Haters
People whining about ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù need to get a grip. KULR‚Äôs tech is already in high demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre working with NASA, the military, and EV manufacturers. Adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet doesn‚Äôt weaken their core‚Äîit adds a high-risk, high-reward asset to amplify shareholder returns.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Perfect Timing

With Bitcoin showing signs of another bull cycle, this move could significantly increase their liquidity. Think of Bitcoin as the ultimate asymmetric hedge‚Äîit‚Äôs speculative, sure, but the rewards FAR outweigh the risks for a growth-stage company like KULR.

In summary:

This isn‚Äôt some pump-and-dump vaporware. KULR has legit tech, real clients, and a bold strategy to maximize growth. The Bitcoin play is a cherry on top‚Äîa calculated move to leverage speculative growth alongside their core business. Risk is the name of the game with penny stocks, and this one is worth it.

My price target? $10+ short term, $30+ long term. If their Bitcoin gamble pays off, this stock could go parabolic. Don‚Äôt miss the boat. üöÄ

BTC weekly chart,"Looks like BTC may not make it to 120k before profits move into alt coins.

Check this out.

MACD is tipping over the top.. starting to make light green bars. This usually indicates that the down trend is about to start. 

STOCHASTIC RSI  is also tipping over the top of overbought.... indicating a reversal to the downside.

Alts will reap the benefits for a while... then profits will later flood back into BTC again once the alt season is over.

Not financial advice.. just appears as such according to indicator history vs current indicator positions.

Analysts foresee upside potential for Bitcoin beyond $100k despite some red flags,"üö® Crypto News: $BTC breaches the jaw-dropping $100K mark, setting the crypto world ablaze. While this milestone has fueled FOMO and euphoric predictions, analysts are split on what comes next. Are we cruising into uncharted territory or staring down the barrel of a correction?

VanEck‚Äôs Matthew Sigel highlights reasons to stay optimistic. Low MVRV Z-Scores? Check. Stable $BTC dominance? Check. Moderate moving average multipliers? Double-check. Even skyrocketing funding rates haven't derailed the rally yet. Bulls are keeping their horns sharp. 

But hold up‚ÄîGlassnode is waving some caution flags. Metrics like the Realized Supply Density and NUPL are flashing potential volatility risks. With over 90% of Bitcoin's supply now profitable, the urge to secure gains could trigger sell-offs, putting pressure on the market. 

However, it‚Äôs not all bad news. Cooling speculative behaviors and dwindling realized profits hint that the market might navigate these choppy waters with some resilience. Can Bitcoin sustain its record-shattering momentum or will the bears make a surprise appearance?

Would Babydoge go $1 in the Crypto World,"For **Baby Dogecoin** (BabyDoge) to reach $1, similar to PEPE, it's important to consider several key factors that would make it extremely challenging:

# 1. Market Capitalization and Supply

Baby Dogecoin has an **enormous total supply** of **420 quadrillion coins** (compared to Bitcoin's 21 million supply). For Baby Doge to hit $1 per coin, the market cap would need to reach **$420 quadrillion**, which is far beyond the current total market cap of all cryptocurrencies (about $1 trillion).

To put this into perspective:

* The current global stock market's total value is roughly $100 trillion.
* For Baby Dogecoin to reach $1, its market cap would be more than **4,200 times** the total value of the entire stock market. This makes such a scenario practically impossible unless there is a drastic change in either its supply or the overall crypto market.

# 2. Supply Burn Mechanisms

One potential way Baby Doge could ever approach a higher price point would be through **supply reductions** (i.e., coin burns). However, the current supply is so high that even substantial burns would only reduce the total supply by a small fraction over time. Given how much Baby Dogecoin would need to be burned to even get close to $1, it's unlikely to reach that price unless a **massive and consistent burn** occurred, which would be difficult to sustain.

# 3. Community and Popularity

Baby Dogecoin, like many other meme coins, depends heavily on its **community** and **hype**. Baby Doge has a loyal following and has capitalized on the meme coin trend, gaining attention through social media, influencers, and celebrity endorsements. However, long-term, it‚Äôs unclear whether this hype can sustain Baby Dogecoin's price at a level even close to $1.

# 4. Comparison to Other Meme Coins

Some meme coins like **Dogecoin** and **Shiba Inu** have seen massive gains in recent years, but even those coins have not reached $1, despite having more established communities and greater market recognition. Dogecoin, for example, has a much smaller supply compared to Baby Doge but has struggled to break the $1 mark in a market where its community-driven value is a big factor.

# 5. External Factors (Regulation and Market Trends)

The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is becoming stricter globally. Meme coins often face more scrutiny because of their speculative nature and the risk of manipulation or pump-and-dump schemes. This could affect Baby Dogecoin's price and future potential.

# Conclusion

While Baby Dogecoin could continue to see price movements driven by hype, community involvement, and market trends, reaching $1 seems virtually impossible given its massive supply and current market conditions.

The price of meme coins like Baby Dogecoin is highly speculative, and investing in them carries significant risk. If you're considering investing in Baby Dogecoin or any other meme coin, it‚Äôs essential to understand the inherent volatility and the unlikely nature of such extreme price targets.",Saddaf_Khan,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto2027/comments/1h7pec2/would_babydoge_go_1_in_the_crypto_world/,2024-12-06 01:14:10,1,title,0.0,0.031,0.889,0.08,0.9353

Reasons why the DonOLD needed Elon to get back into the White House

As Kamala stated in the presidential debate on X night, ‚Äúit is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. The reasons why I believe Trump needed to be in the White House 2024

1. Trump is scared of prison and using the Presidential role to dismiss his court cases
2. Looming debts from his $454m, 34 count conviction in NY to his $81m¬†civit suit with E. Jean Carroll
3. Trumps ego to be the most powerful person in the world and to line his own pockets for personal gain for his businesses and family

# Reasons why David Sacks wants to push his agenda to the White House

What the crypto industry has been asking for more than anything else is a clear legal framework to operate under. If Trump wins, the industry will get this, and more innovation will happen in the U.S. If Harris wins, Warren & Gensler will keep driving the train, and innovation will be driven offshore. This should be an easy choice for anyone in the industry. [( tweet)](https://xcancel.com/DavidSacks/status/1817982596330221714#m) Fundamentally David believes that the Biden administration is getting carried away with regulations. Biden has a hostile innovation agenda and that he is doing everything he can do to alienate Silicon Valley.

* hostile to AI¬† ( AI needs energy and the US doesn‚Äôt¬† have nuclear energy)¬†
* hostile to crypto
* hostile to M&A
* hostile to options as compensation

David Sacks is the primary person that brought a majority of the billionaires to the table. Tech billionaires want to bring in outside people to come in and shake things up. The first inning in their plan will be for radical truth seeking transparency and sharing (the release of the epstein/diddy/JFK files). They believe that AI will help automate the Government take all the files and¬† load them through AI so people can ask questions of the data and to automate or eliminate departments of people. Use data to establish trust. Want a massive declassification of the federal government

# Elon motivations to help Trump win the White House

To recoup lost investment, control AI narrative, and follow through with his promise to hand Ukraine territory over to Russia. Elon is struggling with recouping his funds from the Twitter acquisition and his frustration with the Biden Administration for implementing the Chips Act which adds extra regulations to the advancement of AI. With Musk's recent launch in xAI, Elon and his silicon valley tech buddies do not want to be hindered from innovating quickly and pushing boundaries with AI.¬† On top of that Musk has had billions of government grants for SpaceX and Tesla. Biden‚Äôs administration started giving out more handouts to his competition like Rivian ($6.6B) or blocking his [6/11/2024 - $56m compensation package](https://boardagenda.com/2024/06/11/shareholder-showdown-looms-for-elon-musk/).¬†

Post election Musk has been vocal about¬† blocking OpenAI from becoming profitable and announcing that they DOGE will be trying to strip the $6.6B government grant once Trump comes into office. It seems Elon needs to make due on promises to his investors (Saudis, Putin and David Sachs) and to grow his own companies with Trump government funding and block all his competitors (China car manufacturers, Rivian, OpenAI, Google, etc)¬†

Unlawful Escheatment of Crypto by California,"I live in California and believe the state has unlawfully confiscated some of my crypto coins. The coins were being held in Coinbase, but against my will, were sold, turned into US dollars, and were sent to California escheatment in mid July 2023 (but I just learned about this today).

However, I have proof that my Coinbase account was not inactive at the time the assets were confiscated. I have proof of password reset, login, and two customer service chats \~1 week prior to the confiscation.

My property should still be eligible to be claimed via California's unclaimed property website, however, since the coins were converted to US dollars, it'd be claimed at 1/3 of today's coin value (Bitcoin was trading at \~$29k in July 2023, it is now \~$97k).

**Do I have grounds for a legal case against Coinbase or the state of California for an unlawful escheatment of my assets?** 

Full disclosure, the value of the coins is not huge, but I'm pretty annoyed both because I believe the escheatment to have been unlawful (I can provide proof the property was not abandoned one week prior to the escheatment) and claiming it today only net me 1/3 of the actual value since it was converted from bitcoin into dollars at the time of escheatment.

One more thing worth noting, prior to the customer support tickets and login \~1 week before confiscation, the account had indeed been inactive because I was planning on holding the coins for a long time and was not an active trader.

**Post:**  
In just one hour, Bitcoin's price fell from $98,000 to $90,000. With a total supply of 21 million BTC, this means a massive loss:  
**$8,000 x 21,000,000 BTC = $168,000,000,000**  
An enormous drop in market value in such a short time!

Bitcoin price update. Flash crash. Volumes down. Price direction is uncertain.,"I guess everyone saw the flash crash that happened with the longs destroyed thats why in my earlier post i said around 97k we re in trouble. The price currently is at 98500 and low volume. Price action is uncertain with the liquidity building up in the 101k and 95k short term (first pic). Long term chart indicates a lot of longs still to be liquidated under 90k (2nd pic).

Not trying to scare anyone but below 90k is still in play and is a decent possibility. Judging by the price action and trend we are struggling to hit a new high and is still on a downward movement with lower highs (3rd pic).


I cashed out today around 101k, i did it for many reasons but it could be possibly a wrong choice. I saw the downward pressure and knew its going to happen but reversals can always  come into play, a huge upward trend above 104 tonight is not out of play either.

I decided to cash out too because i realized MSTR is starting to be disconnected from bitcoin prices. Good news isnt really pushing the stock as hard and bad news is just wrecking it. 

I decided to invest into ETH leveraged etfs for now because ETH is really underpriced and if you know crypto ETH is always slower than BTC to start a bullrun. I see 3-5x potential. Also dogecoin is ETH and Elon musk has made jt clear hes going to use Doge as a method of payment on his business and government projects.

But let me make it clear, dont listen to me or anyone about your investment choices. Use the knowledge to do your homework and research then decide. 

I will come back to MSTR if bitcoin drops below 88k and I see a massive correction on MSTR. If not, then  its okay and I wish everyone will make a lot of money. ",lowriskhighvalue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7qndp,2024-12-06 02:17:22,3,title,1.0,0.11,0.802,0.088,-0.5483

Capital Group Portfolio B101 is a crypto scam and upcoming mass text campaign.,"# WHO?

I received a text from an unknown phone number promoting a crypto investment opportunity.

# WHAT?

The text claimed that Bitcoin is heading to $100K and offered real-time updates for consistent weekly growth. It included a link (removed for cybersecurity reasons) that led to a WhatsApp group named Capital Group Portfolio B101. As a long-time lurker of r/Scams and a tech junkie with an interest in cybersecurity (currently pursuing an associate degree in cybersecurity), I decided to investigate the text and link using professional tools and precautions.

# WHEN?

I received the text on December 5, 2024, at 7:36 PM.

# WHERE?

The text link led to a WhatsApp group. The associated website (redacted for cybersecurity) lacked legitimate contact information and had very little transparency about its operations.

# WHY?

I'm posting this to raise awareness and help others avoid falling for this potential scam. I strongly advise against investing in crypto using the group's services. If you receive a similar text, do not click on any links. Instead, follow my four favorite letters: BDIR - Block, Delete, Ignore, and Report.

# HOW?

when you invest into these groups and their version of bitcoin, the funds are going directly to a scammers' or mules' crypto wallet. The victim who invested won't have any monetary value in what they invested even though the victim was promised they would double their money.

Here are some verified and well-researched steps to avoid crypto scams:

1. **Verify the Source**: Always check the legitimacy of the sender and the platform.
2. **Do Not Click on Unknown Links**: Avoid clicking on links from unknown sources.
3. **Do Not Invest in similar Crypto scams:** The scammer's goal is to steal your money, avoid being encouraged to invest into a crypto scam or investing into a crypto scam.
4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Report any suspicious texts or links to relevant authorities or platforms.
5. **Watch out for recovery scammers:** if you have invested into this crypto scam or any similar group or website, people will promise they can return, recover or 'hack' the funds on your behalf. These recovery entities are also scammers.",Isuckatbattlefield4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1h7r5ey/capital_group_portfolio_b101_is_a_crypto_scam_and/,2024-12-06 02:43:18,1,title,3.0,0.132,0.779,0.09,-0.9641

Why I‚Äôm Gaining Confidence in Litecoin‚Äôs Long-Term Outlook,"I‚Äôve been following Litecoin since around 2017, and while it‚Äôs never been the flashiest coin in the room, I‚Äôve recently found myself growing more convinced in its long-term staying power. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Longevity and Reliability:
Litecoin has been around for over a decade now. In crypto terms, that‚Äôs practically ancient. Surviving multiple bull and bear cycles isn‚Äôt just luck‚Äîit‚Äôs proof of resilient tech and a dedicated community. This kind of track record matters when looking for projects that can weather future downturns.


2. Solid Fundamentals:
The codebase is closely tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs, which means Litecoin often benefits from Bitcoin‚Äôs robust security model and proven concepts. When Bitcoin implements upgrades‚Äîlike Taproot‚ÄîLitecoin typically follows suit, enhancing its own security and efficiency. Plus, with faster block times and lower fees than BTC, Litecoin still provides a useful niche as a ‚Äúdigital silver‚Äù alternative to Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù


3. Growing Ecosystem & Merchant Adoption:
It‚Äôs not just about holding LTC‚Äîpeople actually spend it. Litecoin‚Äôs integration into payment processors and e-commerce platforms has been steady. The more widely accepted a coin is, the less it relies solely on speculation. Over time, sustained usage can help stabilize price and sentiment.


4. Continuous Improvement (MimbleWimble Extension Block):
The dev team has introduced privacy-enhancing features via MWEB. Privacy and fungibility are critical components of a truly robust digital currency. While not everyone cares about privacy, ensuring that option is available shows a forward-thinking approach. This isn‚Äôt a dead project; it‚Äôs evolving.


5. Institutional Interest & Recognition:
Litecoin‚Äôs listed on almost every major exchange and has a presence in institutional investment vehicles like Grayscale‚Äôs LTC trust. These are signs that Litecoin has earned a level of trust and credibility with larger players‚Äînot just retail speculators.



At the end of the day, I‚Äôm not claiming Litecoin is guaranteed to moon tomorrow or dethrone Bitcoin. But as the broader crypto market matures, I‚Äôm increasingly confident that LTC isn‚Äôt going anywhere. It‚Äôs proven itself durable, functional, and adaptable‚Äîqualities that are rare in an industry fueled by hype. For me, that long-term conviction is worth more than chasing the latest new hot coin.

You can buy an ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin in your registered account.

2. BTCX.U (traded in US dollars)
3. QBTC.U (Bitcoin fund traded in US dollars).

Nearly $3 Billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Expire Today Amid Mixed Market Sentiment,"üö® Crypto News: Nearly $3 billion in $BTC and $ETH options are set to expire today, sparking serious buzz across the crypto landscape. With 23,481 Bitcoin contracts (worth $2.29 billion) and 148,733 Ethereum contracts (worth $581 million) nearing their end, market volatility is on everyone‚Äôs radar.

For $BTC, the put-to-call ratio sits at 1.11, hinting at cautious sentiment, while $ETH maintains a ratio of 0.63, a more bullish outlook. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent pullback from its $100K milestone has traders bracing for impact, with some hedging against potential declines as leverage cools and massive sell-offs loom.

On the Ethereum side, its steady climb has traders eyeing the $3,500 pain point. Both assets face a showdown between bullish forces and market caution as options expiration often drags prices toward max pain levels. A fireworks show is set to unfold, but remember, these effects typically remain short-lived.

Litecoin: A Technical Analyst‚Äôs Perspective,"**Disclaimer:** This post is not financial advice. It represents my personal views and analysis of Litecoin, based on my understanding of the market and technical indicators. Please do your own research and use this information as you see fit.

First of all**,** I‚Äôm trading **Litecoin (LTC)** against **Bitcoin (BTC)** because I see **greater potential for $ gains** in this strategy. Let me explain.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at **$100K USD** (\~**‚Ç¨93K EUR**). For now, I‚Äôm focusing only on the **next few months**, which I believe will mark the remainder of this **bull market**.  
I'm expecting this bull market to last until mid Q3 or early Q4 in 2025.

Based on my analysis, I estimate that **BTC could surge to $200K USD**, and in the **euphoria stage**, it might even touch **$300K USD** (but what do I know, I might be totally wrong). If you're a trader who wants to stay ahead of the curve, I would set my **first sell order** at **$185K USD** (\~**‚Ç¨175K EUR**). This would mean an **90% profit on BTC vs fiat** during this bull run; from todays price.

Below is a chart that illustrates **why I believe this scenario is likely**.

[BTC\/EUR](https://preview.redd.it/kfel9smh475e1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed8ab2740b2be80b777bf1ab08c457af0a9732f)

Not bad at all, right? But now, let‚Äôs talk about where the **real gains** are.

Trading **LTC vs Fiat**? Simply put, I foresee another **200% increase in Litecoin‚Äôs value**. 

Litecoin holds its ground largely because it‚Äôs seen as **digital silver**, its **tech outpaces Bitcoin‚Äôs**, and, let‚Äôs face it, its recent identity as a **meme coin** has captured the community‚Äôs love. That said, Litecoin‚Äôs pattern is predictable: **price rises**, the **community buzzes**, but then the **hype fizzles**, and the community goes quiet again. Of course, that‚Äôs just my personal take, but it‚Äôs something I factor into my trading decisions.

Looking at the **green trendline**, I‚Äôm uncertain if Litecoin will break through it this cycle. If it does, we could easily see a **$530 USD Litecoin (\~‚Ç¨500 EUR)**. If not, it‚Äôs likely to hover around **$400 USD (\~‚Ç¨380 EUR)**.  
If the price truly goes ballistic, keep an eye on the **$875 USD (‚Ç¨825 EUR)** mark. (2.618 fib)

[LTC\/EUR](https://preview.redd.it/2v6bc0it975e1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8a512f87cb9eac7152e1dd360f0b72121c19ac)

Now, let‚Äôs dive into **LTC vs BTC**.

It‚Äôs important to note that this is a **riskier move**, as we‚Äôve yet to break through the **key resistance level**‚Äîthe **red downtrend line** shown on the chart below.

When analyzing **LTC/BTC**, I found it challenging to draw a **Fibonacci Retracement** since the pair has been in a consistent downtrend. To work around this, I used the **highest high** and **lowest low** as my reference points.

[LTC\/BTC zoomed out](https://preview.redd.it/oqd2uls2e75e1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=f666f863a47a11d3eb9c5a0d352834e550727345)

I believe this bull market will extend **beyond March 2025**, which makes me optimistic that Litecoin will finally break out of its **years-long downtrend**.

If we do break out, the **target price** becomes more speculative. However, as shown on the chart, I‚Äôve identified key resistance levels at **0.001732** and **0.002992**.

In the charts below, I‚Äôve zoomed in to highlight these areas. Should Litecoin surpass all these resistance levels, it could potentially surge to the **top of the green Fibonacci zone**, signaling a **380% profit** from today‚Äôs price within this bull market.

[LTC\/BTC zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/fsdj6wbue75e1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d1b5f30224c87f87317e1f89048cd42ef46805)

Zooming out, we can see that this **380% increase** is relatively modest. If Litecoin were to climb back to its **previous all-time high (ATH)** of around **0.025**, that would represent an astonishing **1750% profit**. Let that sink in.

Now, is this realistic or just **a dose of hopium**? I can‚Äôt say for certain, but one thing I do believe‚Äîthe **Litecoin community truly deserves this moment**!

[1750&#37; to previous ATH](https://preview.redd.it/t1dctqjmf75e1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=23fc50d8b29bd1746f08015c52ee3d1783001460)

When we approach the end of the bull market, you might want to **sell some Litecoin (LTC) for Bitcoin (BTC)** to lock in profits, especially if Litecoin has surged significantly. You don't have to do this, but it can be a good strategy for **capitalizing on the strength of Bitcoin**, especially if BTC is still performing well at that time.

Once you've converted your LTC to BTC, you could then **sell those BTC for Fiat** (cash or other currencies) when the time is right, which would likely result in **significant profits** considering both the potential rise in Bitcoin‚Äôs value and the earlier gains from trading Litecoin.

The key here is using **LTC to BTC** as a stepping stone to increase profits, and then eventually **cashing out** into Fiat when BTC has appreciated, maximizing the overall return.

I hope you all enjoyed this read! Feel free to share your own targets‚Äîlet‚Äôs aim to reel in that **1750% profit** together.

Supply Squeeze soon?,"As Litecoin continues to evolve, we might be heading toward a significant **supply squeeze**. Here's why:

***Wealth Distribution***

According to [BitInfoCharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/), the wealth distribution of Litecoin reveals a highly concentrated supply among a few addresses:

* **Top 10 addresses** hold **16.05%** of the total supply.
* **Top 100 addresses** account for **42.78%**.
* **Top 1,000 addresses** control **71.13%**.
* **Top 10,000 addresses** dominate with **98.18%** of the total.

For comparison, Bitcoin's distribution is far less concentrated:

* **Top 10 addresses**: **5.68%**.
* **Top 100 addresses**: **15.20%**.
* **Top 1,000 addresses**: **32.36%**.
* **Top 10,000 addresses**: **55.99%**.

This disparity highlights Litecoin's supply concentration, making it more susceptible to sudden supply changes driven by large holders.

***Miner Reserves***

The chart from [IntoTheBlock](https://intotheblock.com/) showcases a significant **collapse in Litecoin miner reserves**. Historically, such trends have correlated with reduced sell pressure from miners, which could amplify scarcity in the market.



***The Bigger Picture***

With **demand rising,** miners holding less and whales looking for higher prices, the market could experience a **supply squeeze**. If key players decide to hold rather than sell, Litecoin's already concentrated supply might lead to a sharp price surge.

Thoughts?

Bitcoin's Future: A Mathematical Perspective on Its Lifespan,"
Bitcoin has long been heralded as a groundbreaking innovation, promising to decentralize finance and upend traditional monetary systems. However, a closer look at its economic and structural underpinnings raises questions about its long-term viability. Below, I distill a compelling conversation exploring Bitcoin's future, mathematical limitations, and potential systemic collapse.  

---

### **The Economics of Sustainability**  

To evaluate Bitcoin‚Äôs sustainability, consider this thought experiment:  
1. **Annual Network Cost**: Divide the annual cost of maintaining the Bitcoin network by the average price of Bitcoin (BTC) that year.  
2. **Total Rewards**: Adjust for the total rewards distributed to miners.  

This calculation provides an *annual adjusted market cap*. With each halving event‚Äîwhere mining rewards are reduced by half‚Äîthe price of Bitcoin must rise proportionally to compensate miners and keep the network operational.  

The projection? Eventually, the market cap required to sustain the system could become unfeasible. At that point, Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational incentive structure collapses.  

---

### **Halvings and the Endgame**  

Bitcoin‚Äôs design includes regular halving events to limit supply, mimicking the scarcity of commodities like gold. However, as block rewards shrink:  
- **Price Dependency**: A higher average BTC price is required to maintain equilibrium.  
- **Mathematical Reality**: The system reaches a point where the cost of mining exceeds the rewards, rendering the network unsustainable.  

This isn‚Äôt mere speculation; it's a logical consequence of Bitcoin‚Äôs design. As halvings continue, the diminishing returns for miners could lead to a breaking point.  

---

### **Gavin Andresen‚Äôs Warning**  

Even early Bitcoin pioneers have expressed concerns about its long-term viability. Gavin Andresen, one of Bitcoin‚Äôs early developers, offered a bleak scenario in his blog post *[A Possible BTC Future](https://gavinandresen.ninja/a-possible-btc-future)*. His insights suggest that, decades from now, the system could crumble under its own weight unless drastic measures are taken.  

---

### **Systemic Risks and Adaptation**  

While multiple theories abound about Bitcoin‚Äôs future, none paint a particularly rosy picture:  
1. **Centralization of Power**: Influential corporate players could manipulate the system, potentially increasing the total BTC supply.  
2. **Investment Funds and Exploitation**: Savvy institutional investors treat Bitcoin like an oil well, extracting profit while knowing it has a finite lifespan.  
3. **Sustainability Horizon**: Whether it‚Äôs 2, 5, or 20 years, Bitcoin, as we know it, may have an expiration date.  

In contrast, traditional assets like gold and land ownership have endured for over 5,000 years. Bitcoin‚Äôs digital design and economic model may lack the timelessness of these alternatives.  

---

### **A Zero-Sum Game**  

Bitcoin operates in a zero-sum framework: for one participant to profit, another must incur a loss. The money fueling Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise must originate from somewhere. As the system matures, this balance becomes increasingly precarious.  

---

### **The Long-Term Outlook**  

Bitcoin may continue to thrive for decades, but its trajectory suggests an eventual tipping point. Whether through systemic flaws, external manipulation, or unsustainable economics, its longevity is far from guaranteed.  

Investors and enthusiasts should consider this stark reality: **Bitcoin might not exist in its current form a century from now.**  ",Apart_Split_8801,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/1h7zk4i/bitcoins_future_a_mathematical_perspective_on_its/,2024-12-06 11:46:01,2,title,0.0,0.03,0.891,0.079,0.9501

Legit method I use to earn free btc over time,"I am making this post to share a method I've been using to get free btc for years now.

Plus I am putting my referral code in there so if you found this helpful and are interested, you can use that to get an extra 20$. 

To start, you will need a coinbase account. Here is my referral code to sign up with if interested:
https://coinbase.com/join/9BUNAQ5?src=android-link

(Note: you do not need to use my referral code to take advantage of this method, but you do need a coinbase account, and if you use my referral code we both get $20 after your first trade.)

To utilize this method you will have to do KYC (know your customer) but it is completely free and nothing in this method costs money. 

Sign up for a coinbase account, and fill out your information in the KYC. (They will ask for your personal information, and ask for proof of identity such as a picture of your ID card.) 

Once you have been verified, which usually only takes a day or so, you will need to navigate to the ""rewards"" section. 

Once there, you will need to essentially register for it, (and submit a picture of your ID once more) and simply wait to be verified. (In my case, it only took a day or two.) 

And that's it, you're done! It is 100% free to do this, and once you've been approved for the rewards, they will periodically have sponsors for new cryptos send you quizzes to read and answer questions on for certain amounts of free crypto. (Usually like $1-$5) and tasks you can do for even more (usually like downloading a new wallet.)

Today, for example, I made like $25 for free from these reward offers. I simply take the free crypto they send me, and trade it in for bitcoin, which I then send to my wallet to do with as I please.

Pro tip: if you do not wish to pay taxes on anything from coinbase, (because they have your information) simply avoid ever SELLING any crypto. Once you sell something, it becomes a taxable event. But you can buy, trade, and send crypto all you want without having to pay taxes. 
Simply check the app every so often to see if they have sent you any more free rewards offers which are usually like 10-20 bucks worth, then trade it for the crypto you want and send it to your own wallet. Also, if you used the referral code to sign up, we both get $20 for free after your first trade. (You just have to make your first trade within a certain amount of time)

Hope you found this post helpful and enjoy the free crypto! ",_-Anarchy-_,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h8hhd4/legit_method_i_use_to_earn_free_btc_over_time/,2024-12-07 01:37:53,1,title,0.0,0.016,0.773,0.211,0.9987

Senate Bill S.4912 This bill provides for the acquisition and storage of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin by the U.S. government.,"This bill is a REALLY BAD idea. 

The Department of the Treasury must purchase one million Bitcoins over a five-year period and hold the Bitcoins in trust for the United States. All Bitcoins acquired under this bill must be held for at least 20 years unless used to retire outstanding federal debt.

The bill directs Treasury to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the secure storage of U.S. Bitcoins. The reserve must be a decentralized network of secure facilities across the United States. Existing U.S. Bitcoin holdings must be transferred to the reserve. States may voluntarily store Bitcoin holdings in the reserve in segregated accounts.

The bill also reduces the total amount of U.S. dollars Federal Reserve banks may hold in surplus and requires Federal Reserve banks to remit a certain amount of net earnings annually to the purchase of Bitcoins.

The government would hand over billions of dollars to bitcoin owners to purchase their share effectively throwing the backing of the US behind a single cryptocurrency.",Public-Marionberry33,https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912,2024-12-07 01:35:49,2,title,0.0,0.037,0.808,0.155,0.964

Best trading approach/platform to maximize bitcoin instead of usd? The death of bitcoin as collateral...And where to trade with no kyc?,"Life happened and I took a long time off trading, now I'm back to take some leveraged punts on crypto. (yes I'm probably a top signal)

Back in the day inverse perpetual swap contracts that used bitcoin as collateral dominated. It was awesome in bull markets since trading grew your bitcoin stash (hopefully) and your bitcoin stash appreciated all the while (hopefully).

Currently the most popular perpetual swaps are not inverse, and settle in usdt which seems to me a pretty lame concept in a bull market. So to be able to trade you have to sit in usdt?? Eww. I suppose you could always have at least a 1x long open to pretend you're holding spot, but now you're paying funding constantly which seems stupid.

And my uh, trading partner, ahem... is in the US with a VPN and can't use the places that still have inverse swaps with decent volume like bitmex, binance, bybit, since they're KYC exchanges.

So... Are there any non kyc exchanges that offer crypto margined perps with half decent volume? Maybe dex's offer a solution?

Bitcoin ATMs: The Magic Portals to Crypto and How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Makes Them Even Better,"[bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://preview.redd.it/s6y5ui014d5e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093d2f246da3aca099ea8ad765735d5ff6f7ea86)

In a world where digital currencies reign supreme and cash is slowly becoming as ancient as hieroglyphics, **Bitcoin ATMs** have emerged as the bridge between old-school money and the shiny, decentralized future. These machines, conveniently placed in coffee shops, gas stations, and even your favorite local pizza joint, are the gateways to cryptocurrency bliss. And guess what? With our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)), they‚Äôre about to get even more magical.

# What is a Bitcoin ATM, Anyway?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. A Bitcoin ATM (or BATM, if you‚Äôre feeling fancy) is a kiosk that lets you buy Bitcoin using cash or, in some cases, sell Bitcoin for cash. Think of it as the ultimate vending machine‚Äînot for snacks or sodas but for digital gold.

Unlike traditional ATMs, which are tied to a specific bank, Bitcoin ATMs connect to the blockchain. This means they‚Äôre not bound by pesky banking hours or complicated bureaucracy. Need Bitcoin at 3 AM while grabbing a midnight snack? A Bitcoin ATM has your back.

# The QR Code Connection: Why It Matters

Enter the humble QR code‚Äîa small, scannable matrix that makes crypto transactions fast, accurate, and hassle-free. Every Bitcoin ATM uses QR codes to link your wallet to the machine. Without QR codes, these ATMs would feel like something out of the Stone Age.

That‚Äôs where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** comes in. Whether you‚Äôre using Bitcoin ATMs for personal transactions or setting one up for your business, our app simplifies the process by generating clean, error-free QR codes in seconds.

# Why Bitcoin ATMs Are Taking Over the World

# 2. Anonymity is Key

Bitcoin ATMs often allow users to make small transactions without the need for extensive identity verification. While regulations vary by country, this feature makes ATMs appealing to privacy-conscious individuals.

# 3. Speedy Transactions

Compared to traditional exchanges, which may take hours or even days to process transactions, Bitcoin ATMs are instant. You walk in with cash, and you walk out with Bitcoin in your wallet.

# 4. Global Adoption

From Tokyo to Timbuktu, Bitcoin ATMs are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. As of today, there are tens of thousands worldwide, and the numbers are only growing.

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Elevates the Experience

Bitcoin ATMs may be cool, but they‚Äôre not immune to the occasional hiccup. Misentered wallet addresses? Awkward delays? Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** eliminates these issues by making transactions as smooth as silk.

# 3. Error-Free Transactions

Our app uses advanced encoding techniques to ensure every QR code is accurate and scannable. Say goodbye to failed transactions and frustrated customers.

Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme and it isn't backed by anything,"I am an economics major. I have studied market economies for the last four years. I don't invest, but if I did, I would only invest in the S&P 500. I have been doing a project on Crypto currencies for university, and I wanted to post on here to warn people about what I have found out. 

Bitcoin isn't backed by anything. It isn't a physical product. It is controlled by just .01% of wallets, concentrating profits among early adopters while the majority of users rely on speculative growth. To explain this, think about it this way. People invest in Bitcoin not because it is a currency, but because they think it will make them money. Their investments don't actually buy the companies ownership. When you buy Apple stock, you own a percentage of Apple. When you buy bitcoin, you own a digital token with no intrinsic value, tied to no tangible asset or revenue-generating enterprise. Its worth depends entirely on the belief that someone else will pay more for it in the future. There is no profit being made, no cash flow, and dividends; Characteristics that are very similar to a ponzi scheme. The truth is, you are basically buying nothing. Bitcoin is currently trading around $100,000. Now is the time to sell. Even if you think it can go up another 50K, it is way too risky to hold shares of something that can fall apart so easily. Remember, there is no physical product, company, or ownership. Just like any scam/ponzi scheme, Crypto currency is a ticking time bomb. Get out while you still can. 

This is my opinion, You are welcome to disagree with me but I won't be arguing with anyone. ",Elegant_Coffee_6191,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h8lgyq/bitcoin_is_a_ponzi_scheme_and_it_isnt_backed_by/,2024-12-07 05:22:15,0,title,11.0,0.118,0.76,0.122,0.757

New to crypto and I have a lot of questions on taxes. Any help is appreciated.,"I bought some XRP using Robinhood recently and made a little profit. I'm going to start buying/selling more crypto coming 2025. I have a few questions.

If I buy, then sell, and continue to buy and sell throughout 2025, what will I need to be aware of for taxes at the end of 2025?

For instance, let's say I decided to buy bitcoin at 90k, I put some money in and sell at 100k profiting some. Then bitcoin goes to 90k again, and I take the profits and put all of it back into Bitcoin again and it goes from 90 to 100k once again, and I sell making profits, again.

If I leave that money in Robinhood at the end of the year, how do taxes work with that? Do I have to pay taxes on profits only? Such as, I put $100, I made $100, I have $200 total. Is the $200 taxed, or the $100 profit?

What is the percentage i'll pay in taxes? Or where can I find this information online?

Dealer quantity of cocaine in a borrowed car,"This happened last year, but I can't stop wondering what would have happened.

When I was 24 and visiting my family in BC, I offered to give my cousin a ride home from a party (Grade 11). I used his car since I came in by plane.

On the way to the party the police had a roadblock. They clearly were suspicious of me, and had me step out of the car when they searched it. I told them I didn't know what was in it since it was my cousin's. The one cop was bothered by that and told me ""you are driving the car. You are legally responsible for all its contents and will face the consequences of what we will find"". He then asked his partner to search all the bags. They opened up a gym bag they found in the trunk, but closed it after glancing at the dirty clothes.

When I told my cousin on the drive home he started freaking out and asking about the gym bag. I then looked in it, and under the clothes there were like 50 little bags of powder. Apparently he was lying about affording his car from his bitcoin gains.

I told his parents and they intervened and things are better with him now. But I keep wondering about how closely I came to losing my entire career due to a felony.

MicroStrategy (MSTR): The Surrogate Bitcoin ETF?,"MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR), a business intelligence company turned Bitcoin juggernaut, has become one of the most debated stocks on Wall Street. With a market cap of $90.73 billion and a bold strategy of heavily investing in Bitcoin, MSTR has blurred the lines between a tech stock and a pseudo-crypto ETF. But is it truly a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF? Let‚Äôs analyze the claim and assess the stock's potential.

# The Bitcoin Connection

MicroStrategy has garnered immense attention for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of the latest filings:

* **Bitcoin Holdings**: The company holds over **158,245 BTC**, purchased at an average price of approximately $29,582 per Bitcoin. This represents a significant portion of its market cap.
* **Market Correlation**: MSTR‚Äôs stock price moves almost in lockstep with Bitcoin, showcasing a near-perfect correlation to BTC price movements.

These factors have led many analysts to view MSTR as a Bitcoin proxy, with speculation that it behaves similarly to a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF due to its heavy debt-financed acquisitions.

# Fundamentals at a Glance

1. **Revenue**:
   * Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) revenue: $467.24M, primarily from its legacy business intelligence operations.
   * Minimal growth in core revenue suggests the company is not driving its valuation from business operations.
2. **Gross Margin**:
   * A robust 73.56%, indicative of efficient operations within its software business.
3. **Debt Load**:
   * **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: 1.13, reflecting significant leverage, most of which was used to fund Bitcoin purchases.
   * This leverage amplifies MSTR's exposure to Bitcoin price volatility, making it behave like a leveraged Bitcoin investment.
4. **Profitability**:
   * **Net Income**: -$406.73M, with an operating margin of -12.05%.
   * The heavy reliance on Bitcoin appreciation to offset operational losses highlights the speculative nature of the stock.
5. **Valuation Multiples**:
   * **Price-to-Sales Ratio**: 73.56, far exceeding industry norms, indicating that MSTR‚Äôs valuation is largely detached from its business fundamentals.

# Performance Metrics That Stand Out

* **Year-to-Date Growth**: MSTR has soared **525.39% YTD**, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise past $100,000.
* **Momentum**:
   * 53.22% monthly growth and a stunning **216.46% quarterly gain** underline MSTR‚Äôs position as a high-risk, high-reward momentum stock.
* **Sales Surprise**: A negative 4.43% sales surprise suggests operational challenges within its core business.

# Is MSTR a 2x Leveraged Bitcoin ETF?

While MSTR is not technically an ETF, its behavior mimics one due to the following factors:

1. **Bitcoin Holdings**: MSTR's massive Bitcoin reserves make its valuation and price action highly dependent on BTC.
2. **Leverage**: By issuing debt to purchase Bitcoin, MSTR amplifies its exposure to BTC price movements, similar to the effect of leverage in ETFs.
3. **Market Behavior**: MSTR‚Äôs stock exhibits a beta of 3.21 and extreme volatility (ATR of 43.68), aligning with Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent volatility.

While the leverage is not directly structured like a 2x ETF, the combination of debt-financed BTC holdings and high correlation effectively makes MSTR a de facto leveraged Bitcoin vehicle.

# Investor Sentiment and Institutional Activity

* **Insider Ownership**: 18.75%, reflecting confidence among company leadership.
* **Institutional Ownership**: 42.24%, showcasing strong interest from seasoned investors who are bullish on Bitcoin.
* **Market Sentiment**: Analysts have a mixed outlook, with some warning of the risks tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and others praising the bold strategy as visionary.

# Risks to Watch

1. **Bitcoin Price Dependency**: A significant downturn in Bitcoin could trigger sharp declines in MSTR stock.
2. **Debt Management**: High leverage increases financial risk, particularly if Bitcoin fails to meet growth expectations.
3. **Operational Decline**: The stagnation of MSTR‚Äôs core business intelligence operations could weigh on long-term sustainability.

# MSTR Opportunity Ratings (Out of 100)

1. **Day Trade Opportunity**: **90/100**
   * MSTR‚Äôs high volatility, correlation to Bitcoin price movements, and liquidity make it ideal for day traders. However, the risk of rapid price reversals warrants tight stop-loss strategies.
2. **Swing Trade Opportunity**: **85/100**
   * The stock‚Äôs quarterly momentum and Bitcoin‚Äôs continued rally create mid-term trading opportunities. Entry on Bitcoin pullbacks could yield outsized returns, provided Bitcoin remains bullish.
3. **Long-Term Investing Opportunity**: **65/100**
   * MSTR‚Äôs long-term appeal hinges entirely on Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. Investors must weigh the upside of Bitcoin appreciation against the risks of high leverage and a stagnant core business.

# Trading and Investing Strategy for MSTR

# Day Trading Strategy:

* **Focus**: Capitalize on Bitcoin-driven volatility.
* **Entry Points**: Use intraday charts to identify support levels during Bitcoin pullbacks.
* **Exit Strategy**: Set profit targets of 5-10% and use trailing stops to lock in gains.
* **Risk Management**: Limit position sizes due to MSTR‚Äôs extreme volatility.

# Swing Trading Strategy:

* **Focus**: Ride Bitcoin momentum over weeks or months.
* **Entry Points**: Enter on confirmed breakouts or retracements to $370‚Äì$380 support levels.
* **Exit Strategy**: Hold until key resistance levels (e.g., $420‚Äì$450) or until Bitcoin signals a trend reversal.
* **Risk Management**: Maintain a risk-reward ratio of 1:3.

# Long-Term Investing Strategy:

* **Focus**: Gradually accumulate on dips with Bitcoin‚Äôs growth in mind.
* **Entry Points**: Buy during market-wide sell-offs or Bitcoin retracements.
* **Exit Strategy**: Hold for 5+ years, with the assumption that Bitcoin continues to gain institutional adoption.
* **Risk Management**: Diversify across other assets to mitigate the inherent risks of Bitcoin volatility.

# Final Verdict

MicroStrategy is undoubtedly a high-risk, high-reward play. Its Bitcoin-heavy strategy positions it as a leveraged proxy for BTC, offering immense upside if Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. However, the company‚Äôs dependency on Bitcoin and its leveraged nature mean that any significant correction in BTC could result in sharp losses. For investors who believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential and are comfortable with volatility, MSTR is a bold bet worth considering.

I find it fascinating how something that began as lighthearted fun can evolve into serious investments for many.

What sets memecoins apart from [traditional cryptocurrencies](https://wisecryptos.com/cryptocurrency/) is their community-driven nature. They thrive on social media buzz and viral trends, making them highly volatile yet incredibly engaging. In this article, I'll dive into what memecoins are, how they work, and why they‚Äôve captured the attention of investors and internet users alike. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just curious about the latest trends, understanding memecoins is essential in today‚Äôs digital landscape.

# What Are Memecoins?

Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that often gain popularity from internet jokes or memes. Investors and online communities drive their value and market trends based on social media discussion and viral moments. Unlike traditional [cryptocurrencies like Telcoin, which focus on serious technological advancements](https://wisecryptos.com/what-is-telcoin-is-it-the-future-of-digital-cash-and-global-payments/), memecoins thrive on humor and community engagement.

Memecoins typically emerge from a lighthearted origin. For example, Dogecoin started as a meme featuring the Shiba Inu dog, yet it developed a substantial following and market value. Other well-known memecoins include Shiba Inu and SafeMoon. These coins may not have significant technological innovation, but their humorous roots attract attention and interest.

Investing in memecoins carries risks. Prices can fluctuate widely based on trends and community sentiment. As people share memes or jokes, the demand for these coins can spike quickly. This volatility can lead to both significant gains and losses, making it essential for investors to research and understand market dynamics.

The appeal of memecoins lies in their community-driven nature. Many investors enjoy being part of a fun, engaging environment. This aspect often contrasts with traditional investing, which can feel more serious and detached. Memecoins foster connections among their supporters, leading to lively discussions and shared experiences.

# The Origin of Memecoins

Memecoins grew from internet culture, blending humor with digital currency. They often start as jokes or memes but quickly attract loyal communities. This combination drives their popularity and volatility in the cryptocurrency market.

# The Rise of Memes in Cryptocurrency

Memes gained traction on social media, becoming symbols for various topics. In cryptocurrency, memes add a playful element. They engage users and encourage sharing and collaboration. As these memes spread, they form connections among users, boosting interest in the associated digital currencies. Platforms like Reddit and Twitter played a significant role in this growth.

# Notable Early Memecoins

Dogecoin, launched in December 2013, stands as one of the first memecoins. It started as a parody of Bitcoin but attracted a large following. Shiba Inu, introduced in August 2020, aimed to capitalize on Dogecoin's success while promoting community involvement. SafeMoon, released in March 2021, used innovative features to engage users. These early examples laid the foundation for the memecoin phenomenon, inspiring new projects that combine humor and investment potential.

# Characteristics of Memecoins

Memecoins possess unique traits that set them apart from traditional cryptocurrencies. Understanding these traits aids in grasping their appeal and risks.

# Community Engagement

Community engagement defines memecoins. Users actively participate in discussions and promotions across platforms like Reddit and Twitter. Memecoins often gain traction through memes and viral content. For instance, Dogecoin's rise stems from its vibrant community, which shares funny posts and memes regularly. This bonding among users fosters loyalty and encourages new investors to join.

# Volatility and Speculation

Volatility marks memecoins. Prices can shift rapidly, often influenced by social media trends or celebrity endorsements. For example, a single tweet can trigger significant price changes. Investors often speculate on these fluctuations, hoping to profit from short-term gains. This unpredictability carries risk, making it crucial for investors to stay informed and cautious while navigating the memecoin landscape.

# Popular Memecoins Today

Memecoins capture attention in the cryptocurrency market. Their viral nature and community spirit fuel interest. Here are some popular memecoins.

# Dogecoin

Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from a meme. It gained traction because of its fun branding and strong community. Dogecoin's active users promote it widely on social media. Celebrities like Elon Musk have endorsed it, increasing its visibility and price. The coin maintains a loyal following, often used for tipping and charity.

# Shiba Inu

Shiba Inu emerged in 2020 as a ""Doge killer,"" aiming to rival Dogecoin. It capitalizes on the Shiba Inu meme and encourages community engagement. Shiba Inu features a decentralized ecosystem, including a swap platform and NFTs. Its vibrant community promotes meme-sharing and trading, attracting attention. As a result, Shiba Inu reached significant market value and continues to grow within the memecoin landscape.

# The Future of Memecoins

Memecoins continue to capture attention, blending humor with financial investment. As this trend grows, it's important to consider the potential risks and opportunities in the memecoin market.

# Potential Risks

Memecoins carry significant risks. They often experience high price volatility. Prices can change quickly based on social media trends or influencer endorsements. Investors may lose large amounts of money in a short time. It's crucial for me to research thoroughly and understand the project before investing. Additionally, the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market leads to potential scams. Always approach memecoins with caution.

# Opportunities for Investors

Despite the risks, memecoins offer unique opportunities. Many investors see high returns when they engage with popular memecoins. Community support fuels these coins, creating a sense of belonging among investors. Examples like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu show how quick growth can happen. I can leverage social media sentiment to spot emerging trends and potential new investments. Joining online communities lets me exchange ideas and stay updated on the latest movements in the memecoin space. Following these trends can lead to profitable investment opportunities.

# Conclusion

Memecoins have carved out a unique niche in the cryptocurrency world. They blend humor with investment potential creating a vibrant community that thrives on social media. While they can offer exciting opportunities for profit they also come with significant risks due to their volatility and the influence of public sentiment.

Can I get some help reversing my deposit that is on hold?,"Ticket number: 14665179

From my research, it seems that depositing my BTC into my Kraken account has triggered requirements for personal ID and other documents.

I have submitted all the required documents, but I received an email saying that my account is being closed and that I have 48 hours to withdraw all funds.

There are two issues regarding this:

1. The Bitcoin deposit is still marked as pending, so I can't withdraw it. Could you please reverse the deposit and return it to the original address it was sent from?
2. I had Solana staked on Kraken, and unstaking it takes 3 days. In other words, it's physically impossible for me to withdraw it if my account is being closed within 48 hours.

I would appreciate it if you could return my funds and close my Kraken account if needed. I tried to contact support earlier about this, but I was told to wait for an email. However, I only have a few hours left until my account is closed, and I still haven't received a response.

i made a spreadsheet to track important metrics,"the hashfactor

here‚Äôs a screenshot of my spreadsheet for tracking investments on Hashfactor. it might look confusing at first but it‚Äôs not very difficult to understand at all.

each time you make an investment in mining power on Hashfactor, you simply need to change 5 values on the right, and you will change your {current daily reward} with the estimate given on your Hashfactor dashboard 



*FEATURES:*
* the top left black box is a screen grab of some reddit comments talking about a different mining service but i feel it applies here as well.
* Desired income replacement calculation and breakdown
* Live BTC and ETH price tracking 
* Manually input the values that are yellow‚Äî all other values automatically populate according to your inputs and the current price of BTC and ETH
* A nice story that‚Äôs told in the top right box near the doge (the numbers are pulled from your data)
* A fair warning to investors, reminding them that this is a very speculative investment and you should only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose



*Tracks:*
- [Initial Investment]
- [Current Risk] (How much your investment would be worth if you bought crypto instead of mining power)
- { manually input daily reward rate} (directly from your Hashfactor dashboard)
- [Daily and Yearly ROI]
- [Breakeven]
- [Days left until breakeven]
- [Days passed since first investment]
- [Remaining amount of initial outlay to recoup]

*What must you manually input?*
- {Date of transaction}
- {USD amount invested}
- {Type of Crypto used to invest}
- {Crypto amount}
- {Crypto price @ time of investment}
 AND
- {Daily Reward estimate} (directly from Hashfactor dashboard)



*Limitations:*
* Does not take into account any withdrawal fees
* Must manually change daily reward estimate each time you want to check your stats

*What‚Äôs next?*
* Add a section that compares your current ROI vs current risk (what your investments would be if you had bought crypto instead of mining power) to give you an idea of how profitable investing in mining power is when compared to investing in crypto directly

APOCALISSE BITCOIN ,"Ho provato a ipotizzare questo scenario (non cos√¨ improbabile in realt√†) perch√© vedo che pochissimi sono a conoscenza di questo rischio 

Considerando che la Cina probabilmente potrebbe avere anche 2M circa di bitcoin, e potrebbe associarsi facilmente con altri BRICS ipotizziamo lo scenario su 2 milioni. 
Chiameremo questo scenario APOCALISSE BITCOIN

Se il prezzo attuale di Bitcoin fosse $100,000 e 2 milioni di Bitcoin venissero venduti nello stesso giorno, il valore totale della vendita ammonterebbe a $200 miliardi. Questo importo rappresenta un‚Äôenorme pressione sul mercato e provocherebbe un impatto devastante. Di seguito una revisione dell‚Äôanalisi:

1. Pressione estrema sul prezzo
	‚Ä¢	Dimensioni della vendita rispetto al mercato:
	‚Ä¢	Con 2 milioni di BTC venduti, il valore complessivo sarebbe $200 miliardi, ben superiore al volume giornaliero medio del mercato Bitcoin, che attualmente √® di circa $20-40 miliardi.
	‚Ä¢	Questo volume di vendita rappresenta un‚Äôimportante porzione della capitalizzazione di mercato di Bitcoin (attualmente circa $2 trilioni a $100,000/BTC).
	‚Ä¢	Crollo del prezzo:
	‚Ä¢	Una vendita cos√¨ massiccia creerebbe uno squilibrio enorme tra domanda e offerta.
	‚Ä¢	Possibile calo: Il prezzo potrebbe facilmente crollare del 70-90% o pi√π, scendendo sotto $30,000 o anche meno, poich√© non ci sarebbero abbastanza acquirenti pronti ad assorbire l‚Äôofferta.

2. Profondit√† del mercato e slippage
	‚Ä¢	Order book insufficienti:
	‚Ä¢	Gli order book degli exchange non possono gestire un volume cos√¨ grande in breve tempo. Gli ordini di vendita svuoterebbero rapidamente i livelli di acquisto, facendo crollare il prezzo ad ogni esecuzione.
	‚Ä¢	Slippage drammatico: La vendita di un volume cos√¨ alto causerebbe un effetto domino, con il prezzo che precipiterebbe ad ogni ordine successivo.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidit√† insufficiente:
	‚Ä¢	Sebbene Bitcoin sia considerato un mercato relativamente liquido, una vendita di $200 miliardi √® troppo grande rispetto alla capacit√† attuale di assorbimento del mercato.

3. Effetti psicologici e reazione degli investitori
	‚Ä¢	Panic selling:
	‚Ä¢	Gli investitori, vedendo un crollo cos√¨ drammatico, inizierebbero a vendere le proprie posizioni per paura di ulteriori ribassi, aggravando la caduta del prezzo.
	‚Ä¢	La paura potrebbe estendersi a tutto il mercato delle criptovalute, causando una liquidazione di massa.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidazioni forzate:
	‚Ä¢	Molti trader che utilizzano leva finanziaria verrebbero liquidati automaticamente, aggiungendo ulteriore pressione di vendita.
	‚Ä¢	Queste liquidazioni amplificherebbero la volatilit√†, portando il prezzo a livelli estremamente bassi.

4. Impatto a lungo termine
	‚Ä¢	Danno alla reputazione di Bitcoin:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin √® considerato una riserva di valore digitale, ma un evento cos√¨ drammatico potrebbe danneggiare la fiducia degli investitori per anni.
	‚Ä¢	Anche le istituzioni finanziarie che hanno investito in Bitcoin potrebbero ritirarsi dal mercato.
	‚Ä¢	Regolamentazioni pi√π severe:
	‚Ä¢	Le autorit√† potrebbero intervenire con regolamentazioni pi√π rigide, vedendo in questo evento un esempio dei rischi sistemici del mercato crypto.
	‚Ä¢	Recupero lento:
	‚Ä¢	Dopo un crollo cos√¨ significativo, il prezzo potrebbe recuperare nel lungo termine, ma ci vorrebbero probabilmente anni per ritornare ai livelli pre-crisi, soprattutto a $100,000.

Stime sull‚Äôimpatto del prezzo

Confronto con la liquidit√† attuale:
	‚Ä¢	Volume di scambi giornaliero: $20-40 miliardi.
	‚Ä¢	Valore di 2 milioni di BTC a $100,000: $200 miliardi.
	‚Ä¢	L‚Äôofferta venduta sarebbe 5-10 volte superiore alla normale liquidit√† giornaliera, portando a uno shock di mercato.

Possibili livelli di prezzo post-vendita:
	‚Ä¢	In uno scenario pessimistico, il prezzo potrebbe crollare a:
	‚Ä¢	$10,000-$20,000: Livelli storici di forte supporto.
	‚Ä¢	In caso di panico estremo, potrebbe persino scendere sotto $5,000.

Conclusione

Una vendita di 2 milioni di Bitcoin a $100,000 in un solo giorno avrebbe effetti devastanti:
	1.	Crollo del prezzo: Una caduta del 70-90% o pi√π, portando Bitcoin a livelli di $10,000 o inferiori.
	2.	Panico globale: La perdita di fiducia porterebbe molti investitori, sia retail che istituzionali, a uscire dal mercato.
	3.	Regolamentazioni severe: Governi e autorit√† finanziarie interverrebbero probabilmente per regolamentare il mercato crypto in modo pi√π stringente.

Un evento del genere rappresenterebbe uno dei momenti pi√π drammatici nella storia del mercato delle criptovalute.",SatoshiNakamotoWife,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1h8s4i3/apocalisse_bitcoin/,2024-12-07 13:07:58,0,title,4.0,0.018,0.982,0.0,-0.8957

The election is over. The ‚Äúwrong guys won‚Äù. Is the Fed about to use temp holiday hiring as an excuse to suspend rate cuts?,"https://preview.redd.it/uxmejbh0df5e1.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1053ca51efec8ce030eab66b562f2bde989f8d09

***Photo above***¬†*- Michael Corleone ponders whether to leave a tip at Luigi's. Amazingly, restaurant tips became the ONLY economic issue to get significant media coverage in the 2024 campaign. Scant attention was paid to the national debt, the budget deficit, and affordable housing.*  
  
Nobody was happier than me when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stopped 18 months of dithering (‚Äúto cut or not to cut, that is the question?‚Äù) and finally dropped interest rates by ¬Ω% during the final weeks during the presidential race. It‚Äôs probably what lots of people would have done they kept hearing that it was the only thing to ensure the wrong guys didn't win.  
  
Regular readers of this column will note that I was lobbying for cuts nearly from the moment Powell started jacking up rates. Charging an arm and a leg for mortgages and loans had zero potential to help us build more housing, or produce more food, or cut my electric bill. Those 3 things are more than 50% of what the average American spends his/her paycheck on. Higher interest rates could NEVER have reduced prices on those things.  
  
Today is December 7. The Fed is hinting that future rate cuts are in jeopardy. Chairman Powell says he can‚Äôt be fired, and won‚Äôt resign, so suck it up. Bwaaaah !!! His excuse: a temporary surge in holiday season temp hires. Now there's not enough people filing for unemployment. See link at bottom.  
  
There are two takeaways here.  
  
First, putting some guy in charge of all our money - who can‚Äôt be fired and doesn‚Äôt understand why homes, electricity, and food are expensive - is a recipe for disaster. No other cabinet member has blanket immunity from his/her mistakes. Imagine the Secretary of Defense announcing ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be fired. The bombing starts in 5 minutes.‚Äù (That‚Äôs basically Putin‚Äôs position in Russia)  
  
My second point is that we ALL know why there‚Äôs inflation. Houses are expensive because local municipalities make permitting/construction onerous. Electricity is expensive because AI and Bitcoin ""mining"" use as many gigawatts as entire states. Food is expensive because we pay farmers (mostly corporate farmers?) NOT to plant crops. Everything else is expensive because we have a $36 Trillion national debt. The government spent double what it actually collected in taxes again this year.  
  
Future generations will look back at this and slap their foreheads. ‚ÄúHow could they be so dumb?‚Äù  
  
Future generations should review the newspapers from this era. Our politicians and the media refused to discuss economic issues seriously. Instead, they tried to divert our attention with abortion, transgender bathrooms, and whether restaurant tips should be taxed or not.  
  
I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô . . .

"Il paradosso del Finfluencer ""serio"" che vi convince di non stare speculando (o sul perch√© ad alcuni rode il c* per BTC a 100K o per All-World underperformance)","Il prezzo di un asset √® determinato dall'incontro tra domanda e offerta. Questo vale per asset senza cash flow, come oro, Bitcoin, orologi, gioielli o arte: il loro valore dipende da quanto chi compra √® disposto a pagare. Ma vale anche per asset con cash flow, come azioni, obbligazioni o immobili. Anche se si pu√≤ stimare un valore ""intrinseco"" dal loro cashflow, il prezzo lo stabilisce sempre il mercato.

Qual √® il valore ""corretto"" delle equity americane? 20 di P/E? 30? 40? E quello delle case a Milano? 10X l'affitto? 20X? 100X? Il valore lo decide il mercato. Il resto sono solo teorie. Non conta cosa pensiamo sull'oro nei gioielli, se Bitcoin sia uno scam o se le azioni americane siano sopravvalutate. 

**L'incontro tra domanda ed offerta non √® importante, √® l'unica cosa che conta** (semicit). 

Quindi, quando investite e:

\- Andate su All-World invece di US perch√© ve l'ha detto il rispettabile finfluencer su YT  

\- State alla larga da Bitcoin e crypto perch√© la BCE vi ha detto che √® rischioso 

Oppure, al contrario:

\- Vi buttate sull'oro perch√© influencer X ha sponsorizzato un servizio per comprare oro fisico 

\- Comprate solo shitcoins perch√© ve le hanno shillate gli amici

**State facendo \*IN ENTRAMBI I CASI\* delle scelte ESPLICITE. In altre parole, state SPECULANDO.**  La sola differenza √® che se comprate shitcoin, sapete che potrebbe essere una cazzata e accettate le perdite. Ma se evitate Bitcoin o investite in All-World pensando di fare la scelta ""logica"", vi rode se poi sottoperformate.

Ecco perch√© quando c'√® una bull run di BTC, o quando per il 17esimo anno consecutivo US overperforma world, spuntano post con pipponi sul fatto che il mercato si stia sbagliando.

Ed √® qui **il paradosso:** qui dentro molti investitori alle prime armi scelgono un ""mantra"", spesso propinato da finfluencer di rilievo, e si illudono che facendo cos√¨ loro non stiano speculando o sia matematico il fatto che faranno meglio degli altri. Ma alla fine conta solo il mercato. Siamo tutti speculatori: nessuno investe per divertimento, ma per guadagnare. Anche le scelte pi√π ""logiche"" comportano rischi.

Consiglio finale: usate il cervello invece di ripetere mantra e vivrete sereni, qualunque cosa succeda sui mercati.",SegheCoiPiedi1777,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1h8tf1s/il_paradosso_del_finfluencer_serio_che_vi/,2024-12-07 14:18:32,0,title,2.0,0.01,0.941,0.049,0.9195

I‚Äôm Taking a 100k Loan to Buy Bitcoin ‚Äì Crazy or Genius?,"I‚Äôve decided to do something bold (or stupid, depending on your perspective): I‚Äôm taking out a 100,000 loan to buy Bitcoin.

Btc and Btc2 Differents? ,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin 2 (BTC2) have significant differences in their technology and adoption, despite their similar origins as cryptocurrencies. Here's a detailed analysis of the two:

Similarities:
Supply Limit: Both BTC and BTC2 have a maximum supply of 21 million coins, ensuring scarcity.
Privacy and Efficiency Goals: BTC2 aims to build on Bitcoin's model by introducing enhancements like privacy and scalability, which were challenges in Bitcoin's early design.
Differences:
Consensus Mechanism:

Bitcoin (BTC): Uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, requiring miners to solve complex computational problems, consuming significant energy.
Bitcoin 2 (BTC2): Operates on Proof of Stake (PoS), which is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, allowing users to earn rewards by staking coins‚Äã
BTC2
‚Äã
CRYPTO TRACKER
.
Privacy Features:

BTC2 incorporates the Zerocoin protocol for private transactions, something Bitcoin does not natively support‚Äã
CRYPTO TRACKER
.
Adoption and Market Presence:

Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, with high adoption and a market cap exceeding $1 trillion at its peak.
Bitcoin 2 remains relatively unknown, with a market cap of around $6 million and a price of approximately $0.34‚Äã
COINMARKETCAP
‚Äã
INVESTING.COM
.
Transaction Speed and Costs:

BTC2 supports faster transactions and lower fees compared to Bitcoin, making it appealing for certain use cases‚Äã
CRYPTO TRACKER
.
Potential of BTC2:
While BTC2 offers interesting features like privacy and staking, its success depends heavily on increasing adoption and market trust. BTC began similarly as an obscure asset, but its revolutionary idea of decentralized money, combined with community support and early adoption, fueled its rise. BTC2 could grow, but it faces intense competition and needs substantial innovation or a compelling use case to differentiate itself from Bitcoin and other privacy-focused coins like Monero.

Price Trajectory Analysis:
BTC2‚Äôs price history has been volatile, peaking at $36.93 in 2019 but now trading near $0.34, which reflects challenges in adoption and market visibility‚Äã
INVESTING.COM
. Bitcoin‚Äôs initial low value grew with network effects, a strong community, and first-mover advantage‚Äîconditions BTC2 might struggle to replicate given the crowded cryptocurrency market.

Conclusion:
While BTC2 shares conceptual and structural similarities with Bitcoin, its trajectory likely hinges on carving out a unique niche or major partnerships to foster broader adoption. It may not reach Bitcoin‚Äôs heights but could still find a stable role among cryptocurrencies if it delivers on its privacy and efficiency promises.

eBay Woke Trump Crypto Shoes Prohibitions ,"I'm sure this isn't news to anyone... But I have to share my story.

  
Mind you, I've had an eBay account for nearly 20 years and have listed dozens and purchased hundreds of items. I have perfect feedback.

I purchased two pairs of black high-top Trump Bitcoin Crypto President shoes (pre-ordered months ago). I intended to keep one pair and sell the second for a profit to offset the cost of the pair I wanted to keep. Since they were a limited run, I thought it wouldn't be too hard to do.

I went to list the item, and I received this rather ambiguous error message at the last moment.

[eBay No Item Listings Policy Error - stating that I cannot list, but not saying WHY](https://preview.redd.it/5h9ydm9rjh5e1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f0e2584c97ccee9701c12fa87f8735bee2002eb)



I went to the forums, I went to the AI chat, I tried to find a phone number, I tried all the things. Since the message was fairly ambiguous, I had to get an answer from an eBay rep (person), not a bot. Eventually, I got connected with an actual person via eBay chat. This is a portion of the actual chat.

https://preview.redd.it/e3rj3301kh5e1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e94d9274e40152fd1ccccccd5d343ef315ef44

Notice she told me to remove ""Trump, Bitcoin, and Crypto""

I tried to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe 'crypto' and 'bitcoin' are against their terms, since you cannot sell digital currency on eBay. However, when I removed Bitcoin and Crypto, there was no change. The listing would NOT go through still. However, the instant I removed 'Trump' from the title, it immediately listed. See the attached photo of the active listing with the word 'Trump' removed from the title. Also, don't sass me about the '12' feedback score, I have 2 accounts, and this one has less feedback, but is still over 7 years old.

https://preview.redd.it/9p0jh0o4kh5e1.png?width=2824&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69b569cad2ac072ba45e15baa329cdf9d001026

Notice, that the listing went live with Crypto in the title. The instant 'Trump' is back in the title, the listing goes down, and gives me that same red-line error from eariler.

Taking 'Trump' out of the title of Trump-branded shoes is the same as taking 'Nike' or 'Jordans' out of their respective shoe listings.

That's my story, I know these large companies are woke AF, but I had to share this firsthand, Since I don't have any other outlet, and don't have any SM presence on Reddit it is. Internet, do your thing.

Oh Update, just finished up the chat with the agent, here's the final screen shot prior to them 'escalating' the issue.

Question regarding seed phrase,"I pretty much cannot post on ANY BTC sub. This is my last try to ask a question on reddit... Yes i know this is not the right sub but all the right subs auto-remove my posts by bots!

It is regarding the 12 word seed phrase. I have a SOLIDHODOL where only the first 4 characters are stored.

Now i am trying to retrieve the Cardano i have stored on an exodus wallet. I have my 12 seed password but only the 4 char

Exodus says no. I need to enter the full word in order to proceed.

I am SO UTTERLY CONFUSED by this whole bitcoin madness! Some wallets i need 15 work seeds. Some wallets i need none. I buy hardware that doesn;t work with my software. Or buy coins that doesn;t work with either my hardware OR my software. My keyplates should be a 100% safe way to restore your coins. But i have more then 4 letters!

So I've just heard of this wacky new thing called the bit coin.,"Fresh off the back of KULR profits, drunk on my (limited and relative) success, I've unblocked the crayon goop from my nose to begin to sniff out my next big money ~~making~~ losing opportunity.

[My main method of stock analysis](https://i.redd.it/bkdh59axeh5e1.gif)

  
Apparently there's this thing that's all the rage now called bidcoin.

If, like me, you hadn't heard of this before, basically it's an imaginary electronic currency.

Kinda like the more famous Hawk coin from the Hawk Tuah girl that I see has been hitting the news in a big way lately it looks like this new challenger to the scene, Billcoin, might be ready for the next big run up.

[One of them has a B on it](https://preview.redd.it/ekmo8re4fh5e1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67cbf0666d2d7fd6fffee86d69f205bbba43a00)

  
At the very least I'm willing to gamble on another surge in price over the short term. Whether it's new US fiscal policy to enforce bitcoin payments at border crossings (oh shit this better not give David Sacks any ideas), or something else funny going on over in America, I think anything tied to some funny imaginary digital money is likely to be volatile as heck. *(just wait until I realize it's all funny imaginary digital money)*

[basically I just want it to do this again](https://preview.redd.it/ba65wvgdfh5e1.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a3811d6672fb44f0c894fa019434d5717db1eb)

  
**Note:** This is not an analysis or or endorsement of birdcoin's long term prospects or it's value as an asset, I'm not really qualified to give that kind of a perspective. But, I have a good feeling in my jiminy crickets that we might see a jump before around the middle of next Jan - that's basically it, that's the gamble here.

  
Also, full disclosure I'm too regarded and stuck in my ways to figure out a crypto wallet, I'm old and I'm tired and figuring out Tiger Brokers reward scheme rotted away the parts of my brain responsible for learning new skills.

So I won't be telling you how to set up a wallet or anything like that.

[you've come to a place!](https://preview.redd.it/jvw2wulqfh5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c4caa87827a3ca96f944b7feac435df5011ef50)

  
I decided to just look at bitcoin adjacent stocks already available to me on my broker platform. Minimum effort.

Oh, before we get into it, **just in case** you may be fooled into thinking I know what I'm talking about with the recent kulr success, here's my NVDA chart showing I did indeed, sell it below $100.

[no comment](https://preview.redd.it/52v634rvfh5e1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3115e591039e88e85a6a09c50f6d6616b845563)

  
Any time you feel inclined to think I even have a rudimentary grasp of what I'm doing and aren't just falling upwards in a silly money market, I urge you to come back and view this graph to settle those doubts.

  
**Bitcoin adjacent companies**

I don't want to expose my portfolio to bitcoin directly, but I do want to profit off any short term appreciation, at least to make (or lose) a quick buck by playing some options and stocks on a company that invests heavily on bircoin.

Apparently, it's a viable business model to just take out loans, buy bitcoin, wait for the bifcoin to appreciate, borrow against the increased value of the company, buy more bitcoin, rinse and repeat.

It's literally an infinite money hack. An infinite mana system in Magic the Gathering cards where you do it a couple of times to show your opponent it's possible, that there's nothing they can do to stop you, and then you just 'win the game'

Well, that's my guess as to how they're doing it. I haven't bought bitzcoin but I have played a bit of Magic the Gathering so it makes sense to me conceptually at least. If that's not how they're doing it then I need to make an appointment with the bank.

[Ayo Kiwibank hear me out](https://preview.redd.it/lguorht4gh5e1.png?width=314&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6bb6679f8ee32247681a27d866afc8600b06461)

  
In all honesty, I don't know if it's more simple or complex than that and I don't care to learn, but let's have a look at how some other people make money with it. 



**(MSTR) Microstrategy**

Michael Saylor is like the John Constantine of techno-theologican business deals. A company that was founded when Saylor sacrificed his left nut to not 1 but 3 different pantheons of ancient gods, getting them to fight out over who would rightfully claim his future parabolic success as a shrine to their strength, and therefore driving up the price of bitcoin even further in unnaturally impossible ways.

[I imagine it looked something like this](https://preview.redd.it/dkvf002hgh5e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa42802c6c884a15b34bdfd0feee97a53a7763e4)

  
 *- So how do they do it?*

Well, funnily enough microstrategy were originally a start up focused on data mining and business intelligence, way back in 1989. As they grew and acquired clients over the 90s, 2000s and further, they also expanded into mobile app development, some other stuff- *blah blah, okay, this is the boring stuff. I'm just paraphrasing wikipedia here.*

There was a cheeky little bit of fraud lawsuit that was settled with the SEC with no admission of wrongdoing in 200s when their share price went from $7 up to $333 in a year and then fell drastically, so, make of that what you will I guess. *Bullish*

The cool stuff with bitcoin happened starting around 2020 where Microstrategy invested a bunch of their cash reserves into bitcoin as a ""treasury reserve asset"". To put it simply (like, really really simply) it's basically the infinite money glitch I theorized above but using their cash reserves instead of loans, primarily.

But yeah, it's kinda reached it's meme stock status just because they keep buying a bunch of bitcoins, value go brrrr.



**Other bitcoin-adjacent companies**



**(MARA) Mara** \- Marathon digital holdings are an ""american digital asset"" company. So, basically they mine bitcoin and other crypto currencies. They've bought bitcoin, and run mining facilities, however they have had their share of controversies, notably being involved with a patent troll company, and then more recently being investigated for noise and health complaints by Time magazine from allegations of nearby residents to one of their facilities.

Good enough for me, bullish - featured in Time.



*I'm going to be taking positions around the above stocks, but here are some other bitcoin adjacent companies that you might want to look into if you're thinking of getting into this space. Not financial advice, you know the drill.*



**(BITF) Bitfarms limited** \- mining of crypto coins over Canada, the US, Paraguay and Argentina. They also run electrical engineering and repair services in-house so that's pretty neat.

**(HUT) hut 8** \- self mined bitcoin reserves. I couldn't really find much about this group to set them apart, but on their website I thought this was funny

https://preview.redd.it/vb1ly7vsgh5e1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=10089e3932dcadf96a8d3c7d870732a36e0b2c08

**(CLSK) Cleanspark** \- bitcoin miner in the Americas that focuses on data centers run on low carbon power.

  
 **- Bitcoin ETFS**

For a bit of diversified exposure in the scene, instead of having to try and pick which one of these 'digital asset' companies are going to succeed in their money hack gambles-

**(BTC) Smart Bitcoin ETF** \- our very own NZX bitcoin ETF, nice!

**(IBIT) iShares Bitcoun Trust ETF** \- a NASDAQ listed Bitcoing ETF



I mean, that's all well and good, but for my particular tastes, I was gonna need **more leverage**

[MORE LEVERAGE](https://preview.redd.it/uh23719ahh5e1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed3995019bc138ff7d1a6553f81178037767484)

These bilcoin appreciation funds are already leveraged to all fuck against the price of bitcoin, and as much as this new craze was beginning to hit, I knew, I had to go deeper. I needed to amp up the steaks, I was going to find a 2x fund with the juiciest, somewhat riskiest option contract I could find, roast it and smoke it.

  
 **- Leveraged bitcoin funds**

*Now we're talking.* This is the good shit. It makes you squeak ""woo!"" after you hit the buy button and throw your kiwisaver funds that you got out through financial hardship on some of the riskiest, dirtiest funds known to Warren Buffet's therapist. Perfect for my personal risk tolerance.



 **- MSTX** \- Defiance 2x Daily Long MSTR

 **- MSTU** \- T-Rex 2x Daily Long MSTR *(note MSTU is currently set to split 1 to 10 on 16/12/24)*

 \- Or, if you want to get really spicy, there is **MSTZ**, the T-Rex 2X Inverse daily, a short fund for microstrategy.



Whatever your flavour of degenerate gambling, the markets have got you covered, no fancy techno wallet or whatever the kids are calling it, required.

  
**\* My position**

Now, I wanted to have a bit of fun with this, but I'm not going overboard. I am NOT dumping my kiwisaver that I got out through financial hardship on this, more just a bit of a gamble on this risky thesis.

My position on this short term bitcoin play is-



1x MSTX 100 call - microstrategy 2x daily leveraged

1x MARA 25 call - it's like temu microstrategy

100 x shares MSTY - hoping for a large run up before the div ex date, due to general mstr volatility, and then I'll sell before div ex

https://preview.redd.it/aqg2mn2aih5e1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=11e2263652a10c5e16435c6ceada61a200e1b3f3

**\* The exit strategy-**

I'm not planning to try and hold these for a big payout, I'm just hoping some news event and volatility spike sends the price up so I can collect a bit of profit. I'll likely set my take-profit levels somewhere between 30-50% for each of these positions and look to close them off when the opportunity presents itself.



Either way, should be an interesting play!

My Take on Bitcoin.com Wallet in 2024: Is It Beginner-Friendly?,"Thanks to its simple layout and array of tools, the [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet has been a go-to choice for many consumers first starting with cryptocurrencies. It will still be among the most often used wallets in 2024 for handling Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, but how beginner-friendly is it really? Though there are some restrictions to take into account, after looking over its features I discovered it to have several advantages for beginning users.

Simplicity of the Bitcoin.com Wallet is among its main benefits. For individuals who are new to cryptocurrencies, the simple and neat UI makes a wonderful choice. Simple wallet setup allows for capabilities like sending and receiving Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, which are available even for consumers without much knowledge. This makes it perfect for those who wish to start with the fundamentals without feeling overburdled by sophisticated tools.

The capacity of the Bitcoin.com Wallet to handle several wallets inside the app is another asset. For consumers who wish to handle several accounts or separate personal and commercial funds, this is useful. It also offers convenience-adding extra features like purchasing cryptocurrency from within the app. For bigger transactions, though, the buying feature entails fees more than some other exchanges, so it might not be the ideal option.

Apart from supporting some tokens outside Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the wallet also provides connection with distributed finance (DeFi) applications. Although this gives more freedom, it is still not as strong as wallets made especially for DeFi or those supporting a broad spectrum of cryptocurrencies. This won't be a major concern for beginners mostly interested in Bitcoin; but, expert users may find the selection of supported assets limiting.

Any wallet depends mostly on security, hence Bitcoin.com Wallet provides strong protection with choices such backup phrases and biometric authentication. These tools help you keep your money safe. That said, it might not offer the same degree of protection as hardware wallets for consumers keeping significant volumes of bitcoin since it is a hot wallet linked to the internet.

How has your experience with the 2024 Bitcoin.com Wallet? Do you believe this is a suitable wallet for novices, or have you come across another wallet with superior features or simpler use? Your opinions would be much appreciated, particularly if you have tried several wallets or have been using one for some time. By sharing your thoughts, you can enable others to choose whether the Bitcoin.com Wallet is the appropriate beginning place for their crypto adventure.",tomyvagII,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitVault/comments/1h91c1j/my_take_on_bitcoincom_wallet_in_2024_is_it/,2024-12-07 20:23:22,1,title,0.0,0.017,0.776,0.207,0.9985

This makes it perfect for those who wish to start with the fundamentals without feeling overburdled by sophisticated tools.

The capacity of the Bitcoin.com Wallet to handle several wallets inside the app is another asset. For consumers who wish to handle several accounts or separate personal and commercial funds, this is useful. It also offers convenience-adding extra features like purchasing cryptocurrency from within the app. For bigger transactions, though, the buying feature entails fees more than some other exchanges, so it might not be the ideal option.

Apart from supporting some tokens outside Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the wallet also provides connection with distributed finance (DeFi) applications. Although this gives more freedom, it is still not as strong as wallets made especially for DeFi or those supporting a broad spectrum of cryptocurrencies. This won't be a major concern for beginners mostly interested in Bitcoin; but, expert users may find the selection of supported assets limiting.

Any wallet depends mostly on security, hence Bitcoin.com Wallet provides strong protection with choices such backup phrases and biometric authentication. These tools help you keep your money safe. That said, it might not offer the same degree of protection as hardware wallets for consumers keeping significant volumes of bitcoin since it is a hot wallet linked to the internet.

How has your experience with the 2024 Bitcoin.com Wallet? Do you believe this is a suitable wallet for novices, or have you come across another wallet with superior features or simpler use? Your opinions would be much appreciated, particularly if you have tried several wallets or have been using one for some time. By sharing your thoughts, you can enable others to choose whether the Bitcoin.com Wallet is the appropriate beginning place for their crypto adventure.",tomyvagII,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitVault/comments/1h91c0x/my_take_on_bitcoincom_wallet_in_2024_is_it/,2024-12-07 20:23:21,1,title,0.0,0.017,0.776,0.207,0.9985

Has anyone ever seen this GPU?,"I was browsing Xianyu, a chinese marketplace for used goods, looking for a GPU for my cheap compact PC build I'm planning to buy with my 3¬∫ world country intern wage (about US$ 80 monthly) and the money I make from some odd jobs. I found some of these **RX 6600 XT**s with blower cooler recently and I can't seem to find a single piece of information anywhere on the internet, despite there being a lot of them on Xianyu. I never saw any RX 6600 with a blower cooler before, and googling it isn't helping at all.

As much as I'd love to have one, they seem kinda fishy(?), maybe they were used in Bitcoin mining? Some of them sell for US$ 118 (860 Yuan). That's less than a half of the price of a new one in my country. Otherwise, if they do seem ok, I'll be planning to buy one and have it shipped with CSSbuy.

There's also a chance I'd have to pay import taxes, which are 92% of the product's value (soon will be over 100%). It's an absolute russian roullette.

Sorry for any typos, as I'm not good with english yet.

Stupid Anti-Crypto Talking Points,"1. Energy

Misconception: Bitcoin wastes energy and relies on non-renewable resources.
Debunking: Bitcoin‚Äôs energy use is often exaggerated without context. Many miners leverage renewable energy sources or repurpose otherwise wasted energy, such as excess natural gas. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption is justified by the value it provides as a secure, decentralized monetary system. Unlike industries such as traditional banking or gold mining, Bitcoin offers a transparent and finite energy demand that incentivizes innovation in renewable energy adoption.

2. Ponzi Scheme

Misconception: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme or a tool for criminals.
Debunking: Bitcoin has no central organizer guaranteeing returns, disqualifying it as a Ponzi scheme. It operates transparently on a decentralized blockchain. While it has been used for illicit activities, only a small fraction of transactions are linked to crime (less than 1%, according to blockchain analytics). The same tools that make Bitcoin attractive to criminals‚Äîlike pseudonymity‚Äîalso make it an essential tool for financial freedom in oppressive regimes.

3. Bitcoin as Money

Misconception: Bitcoin is too volatile and lacks intrinsic value to be money.
Debunking: Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility is a function of its early-stage adoption, which diminishes as market maturity increases. Its intrinsic value lies in its decentralization, scarcity (21 million cap), and censorship-resistant nature. These qualities make it a unique store of value and medium of exchange in certain contexts, especially where traditional currencies fail.

4. Inflation

Misconception: Inflation is necessary, and Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply causes deflation.
Debunking: Inflation is not inherently necessary for economic growth; controlled deflation can incentivize saving and long-term thinking. Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply mimics gold, which has successfully functioned as a monetary standard. Its programmatic issuance ensures predictable and fair monetary policy, unlike fiat systems prone to hyperinflation due to excessive money printing.

5. Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS)

Misconception: Proof of Work is inefficient and outdated compared to Proof of Stake.
Debunking: Proof of Work prioritizes decentralization and security by requiring miners to expend real-world energy. This makes attacks costly and the system robust. Proof of Stake, while more energy-efficient, introduces potential centralization risks, as those with the most wealth have more influence over the network.

6. Control

Misconception: A small group of miners or companies controls Bitcoin.
Debunking: Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, and while mining pools consolidate hashing power, individual miners can switch pools easily, preventing any single entity from maintaining sustained control. Protocol upgrades require broad consensus, ensuring power remains distributed.

7. Governments

Misconception: Governments can easily ban Bitcoin or create superior alternatives.
Debunking: While governments can regulate Bitcoin, outright bans are difficult to enforce due to its decentralized nature. State-backed digital currencies (CBDCs) lack Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization and censorship resistance, which are critical to its appeal as a global, permissionless financial network.

8. Altcoins

Misconception: Other cryptocurrencies are superior to Bitcoin in speed, fairness, or features.
Debunking: While some altcoins offer faster transactions or additional features, they often sacrifice decentralization or security. Bitcoin remains the most secure and widely adopted cryptocurrency, with a proven track record and unparalleled network effects.

9. Tech

Misconception: Bitcoin is outdated and vulnerable to quantum computing.
Debunking: Bitcoin‚Äôs development is ongoing, with upgrades like Taproot improving efficiency and privacy. Concerns about quantum computing are speculative; by the time quantum computers capable of threatening Bitcoin exist, advancements in quantum-resistant cryptography will likely be implemented.

10. Block Rewards

Misconception: Bitcoin will fail when block rewards end.
Debunking: As Bitcoin‚Äôs block rewards diminish, transaction fees are expected to provide sufficient incentive for miners. This gradual transition aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs design, ensuring long-term network security through market-driven mechanisms.",Dangerous_Put_8819,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanButtcoin/comments/1h966hs/stupid_anticrypto_talking_points/,2024-12-08 00:15:32,1,title,1.0,0.098,0.742,0.16,0.9886

If it's a very large amount though, like $200k or more than you make in a year, and will have a significant impact on your taxes... then you may have to pay quarterly estimated taxes on it ... to fit in IRS laws.

"Hi /u/seedless0, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

Whether you're looking for broad market exposure or focused plays on commodities, cryptos, or sectors, there's likely an ETF to suit your needs.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of some excellent ETFs for **long-term investors** and **short-term, high-risk traders**, plus information on how Indian citizens can access and buy these ETFs.

* ***For Long-Term Investors***

If you're in it for the long haul and prefer low-cost, broad exposure, these ETFs could be a great fit for your portfolio:

1. **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Tracks the performance of the S&P 500, providing exposure to 500 of the largest U.S. companies.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for long-term**: Low expense ratio and proven performance over decades.
2. **MAGS (Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Focuses on the top 7 U.S. tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. These are some of the highest-performing growth stocks in the market.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for long-term**: These tech giants have been key drivers of market returns and show potential for strong future growth.
3. **SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Focuses on semiconductor companies, which are vital for tech infrastructure, including companies like Nvidia and Intel.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for long-term**: The semiconductor industry has been growing rapidly and has long-term prospects with the rise of AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

These ETFs provide strong, diversified exposure to sectors or markets that have historically shown steady growth, making them ideal for investors who are comfortable with a buy-and-hold strategy.

* ***For Short-Term, High-Risk Traders***

If you're a short-term trader willing to take on more volatility and seek quick profits, here are some great ETF picks:

1. **BITO (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Provides exposure to Bitcoin futures.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: Bitcoin has been incredibly volatile, providing opportunities for traders to profit from large price swings.
2. **EETH (Proshare  Ethereum Strategy ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Focuses on Ethereum futures.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: Ethereum also has high volatility, allowing for short-term gains but also significant risks.
3. **IAU (iShares Gold Trust)** and **SLV (iShares Silver Trust)**
   * **What it is**: ETFs that track the price of gold and silver.
   * **Why they‚Äôre good for high-risk traders**: Precious metals can act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, but their prices can fluctuate significantly, offering short-term trading opportunities.
4. **XOP (SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Focuses on oil and gas exploration and production companies.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: Oil prices are volatile, and this ETF can generate strong returns during oil price rallies.
5. **UCO (ProShares Ultra Crude Oil ETF)** and **USO (United States Oil Fund)**
   * **What they are**: ETFs that track oil futures. UCO is leveraged to give double the daily performance of oil prices.
   * **Why they‚Äôre good for high-risk traders**: These ETFs offer amplified returns (or losses), making them perfect for aggressive traders.
6. **UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund)**
   * **What it is**: Tracks natural gas futures.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: Natural gas can experience significant price swings, providing opportunities for short-term trading.
7. **BOIL (ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas ETF)**
   * **What it is**: A leveraged ETF that tracks natural gas, delivering double the performance.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: Similar to UCO, BOIL offers amplified exposure, increasing both potential gains and risks.
8. **FCG (First Trust Natural Gas ETF)**
   * **What it is**: Invests in natural gas producers.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for high-risk traders**: A way to profit from the performance of natural gas without directly trading the commodity itself.

These ETFs offer greater risk but also potentially higher rewards. They're suitable for active traders who can monitor price movements closely and react quickly.

* ***For Shorting the Market***

If you believe that the market is going to decline and want to capitalize on a downturn, here are some inverse and leveraged ETFs:

1. **SH (ProShares Short S&P 500)**
   * **What it is**: An inverse ETF that seeks to return the opposite of the S&P 500‚Äôs daily performance.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for shorting**: It‚Äôs a relatively safe way to hedge against market declines.
2. **SQQQ (ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ)**
   * **What it is**: A 3x leveraged inverse ETF targeting the NASDAQ-100 index.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for shorting**: It provides amplified returns if the tech-heavy NASDAQ declines.
3. **SPXU (ProShares UltraPro Short S&P 500)**
   * **What it is**: A triple-leveraged inverse ETF targeting the S&P 500.
   * **Why it‚Äôs good for shorting**: Ideal for aggressive traders betting against a broad market downturn.

* ***How Indian Citizens Can Buy These ETFs***

Indian investors looking to purchase U.S.-listed ETFs like **VOO**, **MAGS**, **SMH**, or **BITO** can easily do so via platforms that facilitate international investments. Two popular choices are:

1. **Vested Finance**
   * **What it is**: Vested Finance allows Indian investors to access U.S. stocks and ETFs directly.
   * **How to buy**: You can create an account on [Vested Finance](https://vestedfinance.com/in/), fund your account, and start investing in U.S. ETFs.
2. **INDmoney**
   * **What it is**: INDmoney also provides access to U.S. stocks and ETFs for Indian investors.
   * **How to buy**: You can sign up at [INDmoney](https://www.indmoney.com/login), link your bank account, and start trading.

These platforms handle the paperwork, currency conversion, and give you direct access to U.S. financial markets. Keep in mind that investing in U.S. securities may involve additional charges such as currency conversion fees or taxes on capital gains, so make sure to research the associated costs.

***Conclusion***

Whether you're a long-term investor looking for stable growth or a high-risk trader targeting short-term opportunities, ETFs offer a variety of options to suit your needs. For Indian investors, platforms like **Vested Finance** and **INDmoney** make it easy to access U.S. markets and buy ETFs like **VOO**, **MAGS**, **SMH**, and more. Always make sure to do your research and consider the risks involved, especially with leveraged and inverse ETFs. Happy investing!

I don't press on random links sent to me on Instagram, I'm very cautious, I have 2fa and log in alerts on and I have a strong password. 

I wake up from my nap and turn on my phone, I'm still logged into Instagram and someone deleted my post, posted a story about bitcoin and posted a story about trading bitcoin and followed around 180 bot accounts. I checked the logged in devices and there's no device outside my own. I changed my password and deleted the post. 

I'm worried that the hackers still have my profile despite me changing password because I didn't get a log in alert and there wasn't a new registered device.

Bitcoin: The Joke That‚Äôs Now On Them üòÇ,"Hey fellow Bitcoiners,

Remember when Bitcoin was just a joke? üòÜ People laughed, called it a scam, said it was ‚Äúworthless‚Äù, and questioned how anyone could trust something ‚Äújust based on math‚Äù (as if math is some kind of sorcery ü§î).

Well, now look at us.

It‚Äôs 2024, and Bitcoin is sitting pretty at $30,000+ (on a good day), while Fiat currencies are out here acting like they‚Äôre in a bad episode of ""Survivor."" Meanwhile, ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is now a buzzword that gets thrown around in every pitch meeting‚Äîeven by companies that still think Web 2.0 is the latest thing.

Remember the ‚ÄúTulip Mania‚Äù comparisons? üòÇ Yeah, that‚Äôs cute. The joke was on us, and now we‚Äôre laughing all the way to the moon.

So, to everyone who doubted us, here‚Äôs a little message from the Bitcoin community:
We‚Äôre still here, still decentralizing, and still HODLing. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll leave the ‚Äútold you so‚Äù for later. üòâ

P.S. Did anyone else see that Tesla just bought more Bitcoin? I guess they were waiting for the punchline too. üòú

This surge created a ripple effect, boosting exchange tokens to newer heights, but none have performed as strongly as BGB. Starting the year at $0.579, BGB rose to $2.9 by December, marking a 380% increase. This growth outpaced Bitcoin‚Äôs returns and surpassed major exchange tokens like BNB, KCS and OKB.  
  
With BGB‚Äôs impressive rise this year, many are now asking what lies ahead. Can it sustain its momentum and continue to outpace other exchange tokens in 2025, or will competitors catch up? As Bitget expands its services, there‚Äôs speculation that it may keep growing. Having already surpassed OKB in market cap, the question remains: where will its price go next? Will it maintain its lead, or is a shift in the market on the horizon?",Woodpecker5987,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinAdvisor/comments/1h9itrk/how_btc_pulled_altcoins_to_new_heights_in_2024/,2024-12-08 13:27:04,1,title,1.0,0.019,0.78,0.201,0.9807

Good for transactions? No.,"Hey there, currently holding a hefty chunk of bitcoin and I just went to perform a single $25 transaction (send) on my Coinbase account and I got locked out of my account until approximately 7AM December 10th for security reasons according to them. They say they need to do a manual review of my account for my security. (All I did was literally try to transfer 0.00003 bitcoin. Sheesh)

So here I am holding many thousands of BTC, invested, and if the market crashes, fuck me, I'm locked out for two to three days. What a rip.

If Bitcoin can't get over this, then idk how it will ever be useful for transactions. And before all the cold wallet enthusiasts and Coinbase haters tell me to get my money off the exchange, this has to be a currency that's user friendly to everyone if it wants to be adopted for transactions (including us mediocre people who keep their money on exchanges).

What's crazy is just yesterday they upped my transaction limit to $50,000 cash. I'm telling you, my account is not some underfunded inc√±active account. I'm literally just trying to spend $25 and now I could get swept up in a market crash.

"I'm against Bitcoin, but I am buying what I can ","Once you realize where society is going, you will realize that Bitcoin is what society deserves. It's a shitty currency that a dystopian fucked up world will die on, we thrive on the unnecessary. It's what keeps the wheel running.

You should have bitcoin for all the wrong reasons, if you don't have it because of principles, you are mostly going to struggle. This is late stage capitalism, don't be dishonest and unethical, but do understand that the world isn't, and prepare for it. 

Don't join that fucking cult that think Bitcoin will save the world from eating itself, it won't. But we are not living in a fair and healthy economic ecosystem, it's a competition supported by speculation. Denying this is the equivalent of saying the only way we can provide ourselves is through meaningful work. Lots of people make a ton shit of money by doing the most useless shit online, sometimes borderline unethical or merely by existing and exposing themselves. If you don't have strategy to survive this Idiocracy, it will eat you alive.

"tldr; Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in early 2021, purchasing approximately 39,474 BTC at an average price of $38,000 per coin. In July 2022, Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings at around $31,615 per coin, making $936 million from the sale. With Bitcoin now at $102,000, Tesla's remaining holdings are valued at about $1 billion. Had Tesla retained its entire initial investment, the value would have exceeded $4 billion, meaning Tesla missed out on approximately $3 billion by selling early.

"Hi /u/PrinceOWales, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Sugar daddy or momma scam.

Sugar dad/daddy/mom/momma scams are [very common](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert) and usually come in two varieties: fake check style scams, and advance-fee scams. Fake check style scams involve the scammer making a fraudulent payment to you that will later be reversed, and then you making some sort of payment to the scammer that will not be reversed. Common examples include the scammer sending you a fake check and asking you to buy gift cards, or to send money via Western Union, or to purchase Bitcoins. Another common example involves the sugar scammer offering to pay your bills, or offering you banking information that you will use to pay off your bills. These bank accounts are stolen and the innocent victim will reverse the charge when they notice the fraud.

The second variety of sugar scammers use advance-fee scams, where they offer you money but require you to pay first. They may ask for you to pay them to prove that you are loyal, or they may require you to pay a processing fee. It's common for sugar scammers to send spoofed emails that look like they came from services like PayPal or CashApp that will inform you that you have received money, but that also ask for a processing fee before the funds are released.

In the real world, sugar babies are sex workers that engage in in-person sexual encounters with their clients. **We do not recommend that people try to be a sugar baby, but if this is what you are looking into, check out the following subreddits for information on how to be safe: r/SugarLifestyleForum/ and /r/SexWorkers**.

"Hi /u/peakpenguins, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake payment scam.

The fake payment scam occurs when someone tries to trick you into thinking that you have received a legitimate payment when no such payment has been made. The most common method they use is sending you an email meant to look like a payment confirmation. In some cases the emails will be almost indistinguishable to a legitimate email sent by the payment service. Scammers are known to also show you screenshots instead of an email. Never trust a screenshot a stranger shows you, because it is probably doctored.

Scammers [spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the 'from' email to match an official address, and make you think you received a legitimate email. To combat a fake payment scam, verify online payments by logging in directly to the service. Do not check your junk folder, and do not assume a payment is legitimate based on an email alone. If a payment isn't reflected on your account and the person you are dealing with insists they have sent it, call support and ask about it. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/X9xn8uw.jpg) is an image of a scammer trying to pull off a fake payment scam. There is also a variant of the fake payment scam where you will receive a legitimate but fraudulent payment.

A variant of the fake payment email is just an advance fee scam: the scammer tries to convince you that your funds are on hold, and that you have to upgrade your account by sending the scammer some money to authorize the payment. No payment processor works like this. If you think you're dealing with a scammer, you're probably right. Always trust your gut.

"Hi /u/Throwaway12467e357, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Advance fee scam.

The [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam) arises from many different situations: investment opportunities, money transfers, job scams, online purchases of any type and any legality, etc., but the bottom line is always the same, you're expected to pay money to receive money. So you will pay the scammer and receive nothing.

It can be as simple as the scammer asking you to pay them upfront for an item they have listed, or as complex as a drug scam that involves an initial scam site, a scam shipping site, and fake government agents. Sometimes the scammers will simply take your first payment and dissappear, but sometimes they will take your initial payment and then make excuses that lead to you making additional payments.

If you are involved in an advance-fee scam, you should attempt to dispute/chargeback any payments sent to the scammer, you should block the scammer, and you should ignore them if they attempt to contact you again. Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

I have a question about a pastor in Miami where my sister is a member of the church. A few years ago, the pastor held a class on cryptocurrency and Coinbase. I believe this situation may be unethical, as it seems he is personally profiting from it.

Over 400 church members downloaded the Coinbase app and signed up, and the pastor will receive $20 for each registration. He also purchased Bitcoins, and today he has become a millionaire. üòÜ

I just wanted your opinion on this because my sister can be a bit close-minded and gullible.",Left-Restaurant1211,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1h9y6d1/church/,2024-12-09 01:19:57,1,title,0.0,0.055,0.897,0.048,-0.1779
Unpopular Opinion: The SEC Lawsuit Needed to Happen When It Did,"Looking back at it, crypto in general doesn‚Äôt have a lot of legal clarity, and financial institutions require A LOT of legal clarity to operate. This is ironic, considering that cryptocurrencies want to replace payments these days, so it was only a matter of time before some sort of government blockade came to XRP. You can‚Äôt have a big technology just change the world without some sort of regulation challenging it, and of course the country with the biggest economy in the world is going to do so (especially when it challenges its own currency).

So, if a huge, blocking lawsuit just needed to happen (and I‚Äôm convinced it did), then it‚Äôs better to get it over with before XRP blows up to Bitcoin levels of market cap. In other words, when would you have liked this lawsuit to have happened? A few years ago when XRP was just getting started (and still just getting started), or a few years from now if/when the price is high and has a huge install base everywhere? Imagine becoming an XRP multi-millionaire from a few thousand dollars, quitting your job, and then having it all go to a sliver of what you used to have overnight because of a lawsuit.

Better to get it over with now. Having the lawsuit and winning was just getting one more duck in a row. This probably gives more legal clarity to other tokens, but XRP at least seems pretty unique.

As pessimistic as I try to be, I am actually quite bullish on XRP.",travistrue,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1h9y5x2/unpopular_opinion_the_sec_lawsuit_needed_to/,2024-12-09 01:19:19,2,title,0.0,0.047,0.828,0.125,0.9502

Then used Electrum to open the import the private keys file, and received the .00518 that you see above. However when I was just clicking around in the program I noticed that there are 2 outputs, is there a source of missing funds or a private key that I am missing to access those funds?

Where to buy solana meme coins,"Solana meme coins, like other cryptocurrencies, are generally traded on decentralized and centralized exchanges. These meme coins often have communities built around humor, culture, or specific trends, and they can be bought or traded for other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) or Bitcoin (BTC). If you're looking to buy Solana-based meme coins, here are the most common platforms where you can do so:

# 1. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized exchanges allow you to trade cryptocurrencies directly with other users, using a smart contract rather than a central authority. For Solana-based meme coins, you'll likely find them on Solana-specific decentralized exchanges. Some popular ones include:

* **Raydium**: Raydium is one of the leading decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain. It allows for swapping various Solana-based tokens and has deep liquidity, making it an ideal platform to find and purchase Solana meme coins. Raydium integrates with Solana's ecosystem, enabling fast and low-fee transactions.
* **Serum**: Serum is another decentralized exchange built on Solana. It features a decentralized order book, providing users with the ability to trade a range of Solana-based assets, including meme coins.
* **Orca**: Orca is a user-friendly decentralized exchange on Solana, known for its intuitive interface and low fees. You can easily swap Solana-based tokens on Orca, which could include popular meme coins if they are listed.

To buy meme coins on DEXs like Raydium, Serum, or Orca, you'll need a Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Sollet) and some SOL to pay for transaction fees. You can swap SOL for the meme coins directly through these platforms.

# 2. Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

Centralized exchanges are platforms where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These exchanges often provide a more user-friendly experience, but require you to trust the platform with your funds. Some centralized exchanges may list Solana-based meme coins, depending on the popularity of the coin.

* **FTX**: As a popular centralized exchange that supports Solana-based tokens, FTX may list certain meme coins on the Solana blockchain. Always check for availability before depositing funds.
* **Binance**: While Binance is widely known for supporting a vast range of cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, availability of Solana meme coins depends on the specific coin. However, it‚Äôs still worth checking to see if any Solana-based meme coins are listed.
* **KuCoin**: KuCoin is another exchange that often supports smaller or meme coins, and it may have Solana meme coins in its offerings.

To buy meme coins on these platforms, you will need to create an account, deposit funds (typically using fiat or other cryptocurrencies), and then trade for the meme coin you want.

# 3. Solana-Based NFT Platforms

Some Solana-based meme coins may also appear on NFT platforms, especially if they are related to a meme coin ecosystem. Platforms like **Solanart** and **Magic Eden** are Solana-specific NFT marketplaces where tokens tied to meme coin ecosystems might be found.

# 4. Social Media and Community Channels

If you‚Äôre specifically looking for niche or newly launched meme coins, you might also come across them through community-driven platforms such as **Discord**, **Telegram**, or **Twitter**. Many meme coins are initially distributed through community projects, and you can learn about the latest coin launches, presale events, or airdrops via these channels. It's important to exercise caution, as meme coin projects can often be risky or unproven.

# Important Considerations:

* **Check for Scam Coins:** Meme coins can often be a target for scams, so make sure to do thorough research. Only purchase coins from reputable sources or exchanges.
* **Understand Volatility:** Meme coins are known for their volatility. Prices can swing drastically in short periods, so make sure you're prepared for the risks involved.
* **Use a Solana-Compatible Wallet:** To store Solana-based tokens, you‚Äôll need a wallet that supports the Solana blockchain. Popular wallets like **Phantom**, **Sollet**, and **Solflare** are widely used.

# Conclusion

You can buy Solana-based meme coins on both decentralized exchanges (Raydium, Serum, Orca) and centralized exchanges (FTX, Binance, KuCoin). Always ensure that you're buying from a trusted platform and consider researching the specific meme coin before making an investment.",Saddaf_Khan,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto2027/comments/1ha72js/where_to_buy_solana_meme_coins/,2024-12-09 10:48:10,1,title,0.0,0.036,0.828,0.136,0.9962

Cheapest and easiest way to dca in bitcoin,"I've been dca'ing a small amount (¬£50 per month typically but a few bigger lump sums at the beginning) into bitcoin but a few years now on coinbase, I've recently just got my first hardware wallet (trezor) and transferred all my btc into that.

I've decided to use this as a good point to stop using coinbase as hear a lot of bad things about them. I've set up a kraken account and bought ¬£10 of btc as a test, I deposited the money first rather than buying straight from my card and this brought fees down from circa 50p to just 10p.

What is the cheapest and easiest way to dca btc on kraken? The deposit first method was obviously very cheap but had to wait 3-4 days for the money to appear in my account. 

Also, how much do you let your exchange balance build up before transferring to the trezor wallet?

ChainLink - incredible utility/intrinsic value?,"I have seen mention of LINK and didn‚Äôt know what made it different from all the other cryptos. 

I see a case for short term outlook on memecoins, and a long term outlook possible for BTC maybe a few other SEC registered ETF Cryptos, but long term I want overly convinced that crypto will prevail.

After all, who the hell wants to own .001 of a bitcoin if you can have, $1000 instead; it just doesn‚Äôt seem as psychologically satisifying and if btc hits a million, would you rather have .000001 btc or $1,000? Seems like a fair case against bitcoin maxing out near 100k (imo)

Now looking at how LINK has some serious utility and integration with oracle, a finance/accounting/fill erp system that billion dollar companies use is fascinating. The fact that these digital currencies can pull live source data to trigger payment for ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù makes me think this might become a common currency for large corporations in 5, 10 years or so.

If it‚Äôs used by giant corporations. They can afford the 1m price tag a few times over, and there‚Äôs no retail investor psychology needed to drive price, this coin actually has serious intrinsic value it seems.

Does anyone have differing views regardling link? My outlook on other crypto is speculation and not the point of this. I‚Äôm not an expert; so don‚Äôt bother getting worked up about my outlook on other cryptos,  but as it pertains to LINK specifically;

Am I missing something big here? Agree? Disagree? Why or why not?

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting. 

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. 

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Portfolio Reviewüìä,"Portfolio Review
Despite broad-based market weakness on Wednesday and Thursday, my portfolio managed to add to its gains on closing bases and rocketed higher to end the week. Although a strong close indicates strength in the markets we are getting little ahead of 21MA currently trading 4% ahead. Tech rich QQQ still showed strong action versus the general market and small/mid-caps specifically.

The AI-energy theme was the day‚Äôs clear winner, helping push AMZN, META, RBLX and TSLA firmly higher. Volume wasn‚Äôt substantial, but COIN did manage a nice close to setup a potential breakout above $350.00

The fintech/AI space was strong today, with AFRM, SQ, and COHR leading consolidation at the highs and setting up a breakout.  To be fair, they have been red-hot recently. UPST was an outlier, remaining negative until late in the session turning green. All fintech stocks finished 5% or greater on the day. 

The talk of the day was Bitcoin, as it tried to make a comeback giving boost to Bitcoin related stocks.  Breakouts are tough: some work amazingly well, while others frustratingly stall. Fortunately, in the portfolio breakouts are proliferating.",PlaybookTrading,https://i.redd.it/nhet1g8whv5e1.jpeg,2024-12-09 19:17:45,2,title,0.0,0.056,0.717,0.227,0.9866

Need to write the IRS - but what's the address? I have a unique problem,"To make a very long story short, I have a very unique issue I need to contact the IRS about. I have tried nearly half a dozen times to call and I keep getting forwarded by their staff to some kind of dead inbox that says something like ""you have left the purview of the IRS"" and it hangs up on me. I don't have the time to sit around on the phone for over a half hour or play games with employees who don't know what to do with me.

At this point, I would rather just send a physical letter. Strangely enough I cannot find an address via internet search.

Long story short, I'm a victim of a cyberattack where my SIM was remotely stolen and used to access 2FA for all of my investment accounts, which were either drained or converted to bitcoin and stolen. Since we're talking about notable amounts of money (grand larceny) which were converted and sent out, I am now stuck with a huge IRS taxable event and these investment companies, as well as Xfinity, have been absolutely worthless to help as my accounts are forever ""under investigation"" for months now.

I have already filled out IRS Form 14039 (data breach of PII) but nothing seems to have become of this and I have a feeling it just went into a black hole.

I need to notify the IRS of why this taxable event happened and I should not be responsible for this in April.

Is Ignition Casino a Reliable Option in 2024? My Honest Opinion,"Offering a combination of poker, table games, and slots, Ignition Casino has been a common choice for online gamblers. It will still draw players in 2024, particularly in areas where online casinos are more rare. For both casual and serious gamers, though, how dependable is Ignition Casino? Though it might not be ideal for everyone, after some time of investigating the site I discovered numerous positive qualities.

Ignition Casino's intuitive design is among its main benefits. Navigating the website and app makes it easy to browse games or handle your account. Whether your taste is for traditional slots or poker contests, the design makes everything easily available. But compared to bigger casinos, especially if you're hunting for particular titles or suppliers, the game variety could seem small.

The portal accepts credit cards, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies as among the several payment options. For gamers that want quick transactions and increased secrecy via cryptocurrency, this adaptability is fantastic. While withdrawals‚Äîespecially those involving cryptocurrencies‚Äîtend to be faster than conventional banking choices, deposits are handled rapidly. Before establishing your account, though, it's important to review the terms since fees apply for some deposit options.

Renowned for their poker games, Ignition Casino emphasizes anonymous tables that level the playing field for casual players. Although the poker experience is strong, some users might want specialized poker platforms for high-stakes or more competitive gaming. The looks and performance of casino games are passable, although for those who value a more engaging experience the lack of live dealer choices may be a drawback.

Relatively speaking, Ignition Casino is licensed in Cura√ßao, which offers a rudimentary degree of control. Although it boasts a decent reputation for payouts and fairness, the licencing does not provide the same degree of control as casinos in more stringent areas. Although most players say their games and payments are flawless, like any online casino, occasionally problems can develop; hence, it's advisable to approach with reasonable expectations.

How have you interacted with Ignition Casino in 2024? Do you want other platforms for online gaming or find it dependable and worth your time? Your opinions would be much appreciated, particularly if you have tried its bitcoin payment choices or utilized it for poker. By sharing your thoughts, you can assist others in determining whether Ignition Casino is appropriate for their preferred gaming style.",palestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetWisely/comments/1haj0or/is_ignition_casino_a_reliable_option_in_2024_my/,2024-12-09 20:08:39,1,title,0.0,0.02,0.831,0.149,0.9943
Try convincing me in to Kaspa more than I already am.,"I personally think Kaspa is a great project to invest in (which I have already done with a couple hundred euros) because all the things I already know, I want to know more about why It could have so much potential for it to get bigger.
Some things I already know about the coin are:

1. Low Fees
2. Secured
3. I heard something about that there can not be rugpulled since it went really naturally since the beginning
4. 1BPS, 10BPS Soon (not quite sure, I would like if someone could confirm)
5. They want to implement smart contracts (not sure again, please confirm)
6. Binance listing soon (Again, not quite sure. I would love if someone could tell me more abt this)
7. Faster TPS and stronger technology compared to bitcoin.
8. 4B marketcap (this is still low for such a safe project According to me)

Can someone please tell me if all of this is true and what else I should know. Not only the positive side but also the negative if there is any.

Why Are Influencers Obsessed with the TP Strategy?!,"Every time there‚Äôs a small correction or slight negative percentage in the crypto market, influencers and youtube gurus immediately jump in with their usual: *""Be careful, TP, and get back your initial investment!""* The next day, when the market turns green, they‚Äôre out there saying the exact opposite: *""Put your house, your car, and your soul !""*

Thanks for the advice, but honestly, it‚Äôs useless. Sometimes, it‚Äôs better to just say nothing.

Here‚Äôs the thing: investing whether in crypto or any other field is all about risk**.** Without risk, the concept of investing doesn‚Äôt even exist. And like I see mentioned here almost every day, if you‚Äôve been DCA  into Bitcoin (without panic TP  like they say), you‚Äôd still be in the green. (I‚Äôm not in that camp since I‚Äôm more into alts.)

TP strategy has its pros and cons. You could TP and miss out on a 2x, or you could TP and save your portfolio. It‚Äôs all situational. But the constant echo chamber of ""Take profits! Take profits!"" gets tiring.

Here‚Äôs another argument that proves why the ""get back your initial investment"" strategy isn‚Äôt always smart: Let‚Äôs assume fiat money continues to face inflation and crypto (BTC and big alts, not the meme coins) grows in the long run. In this scenario, constantly pulling out your initial investment is counterproductive. It might‚Äôve made sense in past bull runs when crypto was still seen as super risky, but for this cycle? It might not be the best move.

That said, here‚Äôs my personal approach: I‚Äôm pulling from fiat and investing in crypto with extra money and relatively small amounts. For me, that‚Äôs a safe and sustainable way to play the game. Obviously, strategies will differ depending on your situation.

Good bull run everyone & good luck with your crypto trading careers, everyone.

How I survived the bear market-100% real,"I was the guy that nearly sold and borrowed against everything to get as much btc as possible and to keep as much. I had to sell some to pay bills along the way but was able, relative to most people who entered, to survive with most intact. I am writing this thread to help people.

The bear market caused me severe mental illness. I'm 100% serious. I got the shit beaten out of me. I think I came close to losing my mind. Then, I realized the following:

1. If you able to go ""all in"", understand most people will never have this choice. Most people in the world have a primary goal-make enough to eat and get clean water. Consider yourself lucky to have the opportunity.

2. Embrace the bear market because you are playing for your future self, whereas most people are playing for themselves today. If the prices fall, that's an opportunity.

3. Find a few things you can do that have nothing to do with bitcoin but have to do with discipline: clean room, clean car, get in shape, etc. The best unknown effect of btc is that during bear markets it produces immense focus that can benefit your life.

4. If you are the ""all in"" guy, you are playing a much different game than the guy putting in 5-10% of his money. Don't try to convince him--but see if you can find a person who shares your beliefs. I found ONE-ONE-during it. When he's down I pick him up, and when I'm down he picks me up.

5. Find someone who believes in you that you don't want to dissapoint. For me I found my parents, and then myself. 

6. Understand people will laugh at you, then envy you. I had my first taste of this recently. EXTREME ENVY.  And they know very little relatively of what I have-lesson is keep it to yourself.

7. If you can, find something you want and make yourself go through delayed gratification. For me it was cars. I went to dealers and tormented myself by looking at them and sitting in them.

8. Understand most people cannot take bear markets. It is reserved for the very few. I have seen a few and saw people make immense wealth in the 2009-2011 bear housing market. I know of properties than have more than 3x'd since those lows. To give perspective, I know of a condo that sold at the low for $200k. It is worth around $640k. the person who bought it was able to put 10% down and cash flow immediately since rates were so low. Their return is $20k invested/440k appreciation = 1700% in 14 years.  the amount who bought 1 condo, let alone 2,3,4, etc, was very low. It was simply too scary.

9. Understand your goals. For me, the goal is not the car. The car is nice but it's freedom. That goal will keep you sane in the bear market.

10. The more bear markets you will survive, the richer you will become.

Luno Bitcoin Wallet in 2024: Is It a Safe Choice for Beginners?,"Particularly among novices who are fresh to cryptocurrencies, Luno Bitcoin Wallet is a well-liked tool for buying, storing, and trading Bitcoin. For consumers seeking a simple and easily available wallet, it will still be their first choice in 2024. For those just beginning with Bitcoin, though, how safe is Luno? After looking over its characteristics, I discovered it has various strengths though depending on your demand, there are certain things to think about.

Simplicity of Luno Bitcoin Wallet is among its most enticing features. Designed with beginners in mind, the software provides a clear interface and simple setup technique. It lets you buy or sell straight inside the app and securely keep Bitcoin. For those not familiar with the more intricate facets of bitcoin handling, this provides an excellent basis. Experienced users may thus find it lacking some sophisticated capabilities as multi-signature support or cold storage integration.

Regarding security, Luno acts in multiple ways to guard consumers. For most of the funds it employs cold storage, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. These tools assist guarantee your Bitcoin is secure from efforts at hacking. Having said that, Luno retains your private keys since it is a custodial wallet, hence you are depending on them to protect your belongings. If you would want complete control over your keys, a non-custodial wallet could be a preferable choice.

Luno doubles as a crypto exchange as well, enabling direct Bitcoin buying and selling. Beginners who wish to handle everything in one location will find considerable convenience from this. If you intend to trade regularly, though, the fees for buying and selling can be more than on other exchanges; hence, it is advisable to compare expenses. Furthermore, the availability of services can change depending on the area, which might restrict some users.

Luno does also quite well in customer support. For consumers who have queries or run across problems, the platform provides in-app help and a useful support center. For novices who might want direction during their initial bitcoin transactions, this is a major benefit. Response times can vary, nevertheless, much as on other platforms, particularly under heavy usage.

Your Luno Bitcoin Wallet 2024 experience is what? Are you comfortable and quick to use, or have you come across other wallets better fit for novices? Your opinions would be much valued, particularly if you have compared Luno with other choices. By sharing your ideas, you can assist others in determining whether Luno is the appropriate Bitcoin solution.",tomyvagII,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitVault/comments/1hajmy2/luno_bitcoin_wallet_in_2024_is_it_a_safe_choice/,2024-12-09 20:34:08,1,title,0.0,0.019,0.799,0.181,0.9967
Bitmain launches US production line to outmaneuver geopolitical trade tensions,"üö® Crypto News: Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain is shaking things up with its latest power play‚Äîa brand-new US-based production line. This bold pivot isn‚Äôt just about faster deliveries; it‚Äôs about dodging customs delays and sidestepping the ripple effects of escalating US-China trade tensions.

The first batch of US-made Antminer S21 Pro units is set to roll out this December, providing American miners with a much-needed lifeline. With reports of miners paying hefty storage fees due to customs hold-ups on past shipments, this domestic production move addresses a growing supply chain headache. 

Why the shake-up, you ask? Bitmain has faced scrutiny over its ties to Chinese chipmakers‚Äîa headache compounded by Huawei-linked investigations. By setting up shop in the US, Bitmain is not only aiming for stable deliveries but also working to secure its market dominance while reducing dependency on Chinese manufacturers.

As $BTC mining intensifies in North America, Bitmain‚Äôs strategic pivot to local production is more than just a business move‚Äîit feels like the start of a trend in diversifying manufacturing hubs amid shifting geopolitical landscapes. Eyes on this one, folks‚Äîit‚Äôs going to get interesting.

MSTR Achilles Heel p/2,"Hey everyone,

It's your friendly MSTR bear here, back with a quick reminder:¬†**The market and the Streets does not favor MicroStrategy (MSTR)**. This isn't just my opinion‚Äîit's a fact.

And the real game-changer?¬†**Bitcoin ETFs/Companies/BTC CYCLE**¬†They‚Äôre the key to dethroning MSTR.

I know some of you might think that Bitcoin ETFs have been around for ages, but that‚Äôs simply not true. BTC related ETFs have only been around for about a year. While there was MSTR they were not popular , why get a lossy 10% when you can get a 100%  from MSTR?  The early ones won, now the chasers are going  after it . Typical of what Buffet and Mark Howard always teaches. 
In the past 4 months things have changed drasticaly as MSTR went into Bubble territory. Clearly overvalued based on debt as owing a BTC is much more attracive.

Crzy part? we're going to see a massive influx of new ETFs‚Äî**hundreds of them**¬†in the next 2-3 months alone. There was no real reason to bet on Bitcoin-related ETFs before this year because Bitcoin itself was not showing the explosive growth we‚Äôve seen in the past few months. Now that MicroStrategy is massively overpriced, overvalued, and clearly in a bubble, the smart money (and even the less-savvy money) is shifting to Bitcoin ETFs, where the downside risk is much smaller. MicroStrategy, on the other hand, is much more volatile, and its future growth depends not on Bitcoin, but on investors‚Äô confidence in the company itself.

**If you're bullish on Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin**‚Äîand here‚Äôs why: If Bitcoin hits $200K, you'll see a 100% return on your investment. Meanwhile, MSTR would likely only see a 50% increase,¬†**if that**. MicroStrategy is¬†**not**¬†another Nvidia, and it‚Äôs certainly not Bitcoin. The correlation between MSTR and Bitcoin used to be nearly perfect, but recently that relationship has weakened. This is because a massive amount of volume is moving away from MSTR and directly into Bitcoin, especially with the launch of ETFs, new companies entering the space, and short sellers betting against MSTR. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow in popularity, the stock price of MicroStrategy could lose its status as a Bitcoin proxy.

You might wonder:¬†**Does this affect the price of Bitcoin itself?**¬†The short answer is:¬†**no**. Bitcoin ETFs don‚Äôt directly buy Bitcoin; they use leverage to mimic Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. So even if Bitcoin goes up, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that MSTR will follow.

Let‚Äôs be clear‚Äî**institutions are not buying MSTR at these levels**¬†without some serious hedging strategies. A 20-30% gain is enough for them to take their profits and move on. They‚Äôre managing billions in client money and their goals are different from yours and mine. While you might be hoping for a massive return on a leveraged bet, they‚Äôre content with smaller, more stable gains. And when they decide to pull the rug, the price of MSTR will plummet.

Already, there‚Äôs been a significant shift of capital from individual stocks like MicroStrategy to Bitcoin ETFs. This reduces demand for MSTR stock, which is viewed primarily as a Bitcoin proxy. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has been buying up as much Bitcoin as he can to justify MSTR‚Äôs high valuation. Every time he buys and Bitcoin goes up, he‚Äôs getting closer to aligning MSTR‚Äôs value with Bitcoin‚Äôs‚Äîbut that‚Äôs becoming harder and harder, especially now that the ETF floodgates are opening.

**A Historical Parallel:**¬†Think back to the late 1990s during the dot-com bubble. Investors poured money into individual tech stocks, but when ETFs like the NASDAQ-100 gained popularity, capital shifted from individual stocks into the ETF. A similar shift happened with the introduction of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), where investors flocked to a diversified portfolio rather than betting on individual stocks. This shift of capital is happening again today, but now it's Bitcoin ETFs taking the spotlight.

**Volume and Liquidity:**¬†Bitcoin-related stocks like MSTR had an average daily trading volume in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Bitcoin ETFs, however, could see daily volumes in the billions‚Äîfar more liquidity, more exposure, and ultimately, more capital moving away from individual stocks like MSTR.

The bottom line:¬†**The rise of Bitcoin ETFs is the nail in the coffin for MSTR‚Äôs stock price.**¬†As more capital flows into Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related ETFs, the demand for MSTR will likely continue to dwindle.

If you're betting on Bitcoin's future, the smartest move is to¬†**buy Bitcoin directly**¬†and avoid MSTR‚Äîit's not the safe bet you might think it is.

Not another tweet about quantum computing. An important update this time. Lots of discussion already around it with most of it fear mongering. Read the comments to learn why you don‚Äôt need to worry.,"Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptography is fundamentally designed to be secure even against advanced computational threats. To understand why Bitcoin remains safe, let‚Äôs consider the specifics. SHA-256, the algorithm used to secure mining, operates by hashing data into a fixed-size output. This process is not reversible, and brute-forcing it would require testing Ôøº possible combinations. Even with the most advanced classical supercomputers, this task would take longer than the age of the universe.

Quantum computers, in theory, could reduce this effort to Ôøº combinations using Grover‚Äôs algorithm. While this represents a significant reduction, Ôøº is still an astronomically large number. To put it into perspective, even a quantum computer processing a trillion states per second would need roughly Ôøº years to crack a single hash. Current quantum machines, including advancements like Willow, remain far from achieving this processing power, as they are limited by error rates and qubit scalability.

ECDSA, which protects Bitcoin wallets by securing private keys, is often cited as a more vulnerable point due to Shor‚Äôs algorithm. This algorithm could theoretically break the elliptic curve cryptography used by Bitcoin with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. However, achieving this would require millions of error-free, logical qubits. For context, Willow, as groundbreaking as it is, likely operates with a few thousand noisy qubits, far below the level required. Estimates from quantum computing experts suggest it may take decades to reach this capability.

2. Bitcoin Can Evolve Faster Than Quantum Computers

Bitcoin‚Äôs open-source nature and global developer community make it uniquely adaptable. The network can upgrade its cryptography through consensus-driven processes. Quantum-resistant algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography, are already being developed and tested. If quantum computing advances to a level where Bitcoin‚Äôs current cryptography is threatened, these algorithms can replace ECDSA and SHA-256. This adaptability ensures that Bitcoin will remain secure long into the future.

For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already begun standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Bitcoin can integrate these advancements well before quantum computers achieve the necessary scale to pose a real threat.

3. Bitcoin‚Äôs Practical Resilience

Even if a quantum computer were theoretically capable of breaking Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptography, the real-world logistics make such a scenario implausible. To compromise the Bitcoin network, an attacker would need to:
	1.	Simultaneously break multiple wallets in real time.
	2.	Achieve consensus across thousands of decentralized nodes.
	3.	Maintain control without triggering alarms or countermeasures from the global Bitcoin community.

This combination of factors makes it practically impossible for any quantum attack to succeed without massive coordination and computational power beyond current projections.

4. Examples Highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs Strength

Consider the current state of cryptography. Despite decades of advancements in classical computing, no one has broken SHA-256 or ECDSA. Bitcoin has processed over 800 million transactions, securing trillions of dollars in value, without a single instance of cryptographic failure. In the unlikely event that quantum computing progresses faster than expected, Bitcoin‚Äôs history of rapid adaptation ensures it can address the threat well in advance.

Moreover, other technologies, such as email, banking, and government systems, use cryptographic protocols less robust than Bitcoin‚Äôs. If quantum computing advances to the point of breaking cryptography, these systems would be at far greater risk than Bitcoin. The global effort to protect such systems would indirectly bolster Bitcoin‚Äôs security as well.

In Summary

The introduction of a breakthrough quantum chip like Willow is an exciting scientific milestone but poses no immediate risk to Bitcoin. The numbers make this clear: SHA-256 and ECDSA remain computationally unbreakable within the foreseeable future. Bitcoin‚Äôs adaptability ensures that any future threats from quantum computing can be mitigated well in advance. Far from being a cause for concern, Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience in the face of emerging technologies reaffirms its role as a secure and forward-looking financial system.",samcornwell,https://i.redd.it/1pqusypv1w5e1.jpeg,2024-12-09 21:09:46,1,title,0.0,0.053,0.86,0.087,0.91

"> Can someone explain to me how the 1st BTC transaction worked if there was no BTC premine?  

The first Bitcoin client didn't even start mining until at least one other peer was connected to it. Everything happened in public since day 1, so there was no way to ""premine"" it in secret. The software was announced in advance and anybody wanting to get coins could download it and have a go.   

So the first transaction (was it Finney, I don't remember?) happened by an user who did just that: downloaded the public available software, mined the coins and did the transaction.  

You can make the point that the genesis block was premined, but its block reward is not spendable, so that point would be moot.",,TheGreatMuffin,/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ham9ge/btc_premine/m19m7dv/,2024-12-09 22:26:58,1,comment,,0.07,0.893,0.037,-0.3489

O que significa quando uma empresa usa um caixa eletr√¥nico (emite a√ß√µes) para comprar bitcoin? ,"
‚óΩÔ∏èThe empresa est√° transformando o lucro por a√ß√£o (EPS) em bitcoin por a√ß√£o (BPS). Mais a√ß√µes reduzem o EPS, mas aumentam o BPS se a empresa negociar com um pr√™mio em rela√ß√£o √†s suas participa√ß√µes em bitcoin. 

Quando essa mudan√ßa faz sentido? 
‚óΩÔ∏èIt faz sentido se o crescimento esperado dos lucros for excedido pelo crescimento esperado do bitcoin. 

Portanto, emitir a√ß√µes para comprar BTC √© quase sempre a coisa mais sensata a se fazer. 

Se uma empresa gera algum lucro, ela sempre deve ser negociada com um pr√™mio em rela√ß√£o √†s suas participa√ß√µes subjacentes em BTC.

O manual corporativo para o bitcoin √© muito simples: 
1- Aumente o EPS de modo que seu pr√™mio em rela√ß√£o √†s participa√ß√µes em bitcoin aumente
2- Monetize esse pr√™mio por meio de ofertas de ATM 
3- Transmute o EPS em BPS usando os recursos do ATM
4- Continue aumentando o BPS acumulando ganhos em bitcoin 
5- Quando as a√ß√µes se tornarem vol√°teis o suficiente, emita t√≠tulos convers√≠veis com juros pr√≥ximos a 0% para aumentar o BPS a uma taxa ainda mais r√°pida 

Se muitas entidades fizerem isso, o custo fiduci√°rio do capital ser√° elevado ao CAGR do bitcoin. Nesse cen√°rio, nenhum dinheiro pode ser levantado a menos que possa razoavelmente superar o BTC. 

Isso √© simplesmente o que os Bitcoiners chamam de ""hiperbitcoiniza√ß√£o"", porque o BTC se torna a refer√™ncia de fato para medir o valor e o retorno sobre o investimento.

Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Weak Buying Pressure as Bulls Remain on the Sidelines,"üö® Crypto News: $BTC buying pressure takes a hit, hinting at potential sideways action instead of a bullish breakout. The king of crypto is struggling to find momentum as its price dances between $98K and $100K‚Äîa far cry from its $103.9K all-time high. Is this a calm before the storm or a sign of bearish fatigue? Let‚Äôs break it down!

The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) is flashing warning signs. With the SSR spiking to 18.29, it‚Äôs becoming clear that stablecoin liquidity, which often fuels upward price moves, isn‚Äôt being converted to $BTC. Translation: Bulls are on coffee break while bears tighten their grip. 

Adding to this, the Bulls vs. Bears indicator isn‚Äôt offering much hope either. Both sides have called a truce, with neither making big moves over the last week. If the bulls don‚Äôt wake up soon, we could see $BTC continue consolidating‚Äîor worse, head downward. 

Even the technicals don‚Äôt look good, folks. The MACD indicator has entered bearish territory, signaling weak momentum. If no significant buying pressure appears, $BTC might drop to around $90.6K. A push past $103.5K will require some serious bullish intervention.

Is Saylor's growing network foreshadowing future success for MSTR?,"Something I've noticed over the past little while is Saylor's network with major policy and investing experts. I can't help but think this will bode extremely well for MSTR. Though the verdict is seemly out regarding the value of bitcoin, with Fed chief Powell comparing it to gold, subtle hints across the industry point to MSTRs staying power.
These include:
- Saylor congratulating David Sacks as the new Crypto Czar. He literally just used his first name, which points to the first name basis relationship he has with him.
- Tom Lee, a renown investing prodigy, said point blank on CNBC that he thinks MSTR knows what they're doing.
- Guy Adami, CNBC analyst and Fast Money regular, not only likes MSTR, but referred to Saylor as ""my friend.""
- Saylor publicly praised and declared President Trump the ""bitcoin President"" last week.
- Anthony Scaramucci, whose bipartisan political and public reach is growing at an exponential rate, got a personal shout-out from Saylor at a bitcoin party
- Anothony Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management and regular guest on CNBC continually praises MSTR and their business strategy. His, along with many other influential investors and leaders, increasing man crush for Saylor is becoming notable.

I could go on and on. The point is that I've noticed that all of these individuals seemingly respect Saylor, above and beyond the fact that his company buys a ton of bitcoin. What I haven't seen are any major investors or politicians praising Andrew Left, and his strategy of shorting MSTR. The experts seem to have a confidence about MSTR that the shorts are not seeing. 

I also can't picture a world where Saylor will be known as a bitcoin genius while his company flopped. If anybody knows what it's like to be humiliated by Wall Street and factors outside his control at the time, it's Michael Saylor. There is no way he is going to let that happen again

Though the share price of MSTR has struggled to correlate favourably to bitcoin recently, specifically since Andrew Left publicly announced that he was shorting MSTR, I can't help but think that Saylor has something up his sleeve that many are missing. Whether this is favourable regulation for companies like MSTR, new technology advances, etc., the confidence among industry experts in the company appears to be growing.

Another positive sign is that Jim Cramer has yet to praise the company. If it took bitcoin to get to 99k before he got on board, it seems to be only a matter of time before he flips his stance on MSTR as well. He is infamous for supporting companies after they are already on their way to the top, while taking credit as always liking them. 

Though this is purely speculation, it seems like it may be sooner rather than later that MSTR starts consistently outperform bitcoin again.

## Immutable Vortex est-il une arnaque ?

## ¬øQu√© es Immutable Vortex?

Immutable Vortex es una plataforma de trading de criptomonedas que utiliza bots automatizados para facilitar las operaciones. B√°sicamente, si tienes inter√©s en el mundo cripto pero no tienes ni idea de por d√≥nde empezar o no tienes tiempo, esta plataforma podr√≠a ser tu mejor aliada. 

Los bots de trading, como los que ofrece Immutable Vortex, **automatizan** el proceso de compra y venta de criptomonedas bas√°ndose en algoritmos avanzados. Esto significa que, en teor√≠a, puedes dejar que el bot haga el trabajo duro mientras t√∫ te concentras en otras cosas. La idea es que estos bots pueden reaccionar m√°s r√°pido y de manera m√°s precisa que los humanos, aprovechando las fluctuaciones del mercado.

### ¬øQu√© son los bots de trading?

Los bots de trading son programas inform√°ticos dise√±ados para ejecutar operaciones en el mercado de criptomonedas autom√°ticamente. Analizan las tendencias del mercado y realizan acciones basadas en algoritmos predefinidos. En el caso de Immutable Vortex, estos bots est√°n dise√±ados para operar en m√∫ltiples plataformas y tienen la capacidad de ejecutar operaciones en fracciones de segundo, lo que puede ser crucial en un mercado tan vol√°til como el de las criptomonedas.

## ¬øC√≥mo funciona Immutable Vortex?

El funcionamiento de Immutable Vortex se basa en algoritmos que analizan el mercado en tiempo real. B√°sicamente, el bot busca patrones y se√±ales que sugieran una oportunidad de compra o venta. Una vez identificado el patr√≥n, ejecuta la operaci√≥n autom√°ticamente. 

La plataforma se enorgullece de su interfaz intuitiva que permite a los usuarios configurar sus preferencias sin complicaciones. Adem√°s, ofrece herramientas de an√°lisis para aquellos que prefieren tener un enfoque m√°s pr√°ctico.

## ¬øQui√©nes son los creadores de Immutable Vortex?

Aqu√≠ es donde la cosa se pone un poco turbia. Los fundadores de Immutable Vortex a√∫n no han revelado sus identidades. Esto puede ser una bandera roja para algunos, pero no es raro en el mundo de las criptomonedas, donde el anonimato puede ser una ventaja. 

Lo importante es que, hasta ahora, la plataforma parece estar cumpliendo con sus promesas y cuenta con una comunidad creciente de usuarios satisfechos. Sin embargo, siempre es bueno tener un poco de escepticismo saludable.

## Caracter√≠sticas clave de Immutable Vortex

## Tasas y comisiones en Immutable Vortex

Immutable Vortex cobra una comisi√≥n del 0.5% por operaci√≥n, lo cual es bastante est√°ndar en comparaci√≥n con otras plataformas. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que estas comisiones pueden acumularse si realizas muchas operaciones peque√±as.

## Tasa de √©xito de Immutable Vortex

La plataforma afirma tener una tasa de √©xito del 85%, lo cual, si es cierto, es bastante impresionante. Sin embargo, siempre hay que tomar estas cifras con un grano de sal. El mercado de criptomonedas es extremadamente vol√°til y, aunque los bots pueden ayudar a mitigar algunos riesgos, no hay garant√≠as de √©xito.

This is My Final Warning | Why You Need Bitcoin,"This is the last video I'm going to create explaining why you should buy Bitcoin. In this video I go over why Bitcoin is currently trading the way it is, and how the price gets to $200,000, I show clips of financial experts explanation of Bitcoin's importance, why fiat should not trusted, and finally the top ten reasons why people have yet to buy any Bitcoin and my response to them.

New Buttcoin lore just dropped,"Recently heard a buttcoiner come up with a new explanation for their ponzi schemes. What they said was something like this:

""Think of when we lived in small communities, everyone contributed and their contributions were stored in the minds and memories of others, to be repaid later. In other words people owed each other favours. When the community got bigger they decided to write down contributions on a piece of paper to keep track. Bitcoin is just this idea taken to a global scale on a global ledger.""

The problem with their explanation is everyone is just recording their names on the ledger without doing anything and hoping the number goes up. The reality is that ledger is worthless and has no intrinsic value.

Or another piece of cope:

""Bitcoin is a free market asset, people are looking for the best instrument to store their money overtime without their wealth being inflated away. Bitcoin is the most scarce and best performing asset with no counterparty risk with which to do that with.""

The problem here that even a two year old could spot is, even if Buttcoin has gone up on average 60% a year for the last 15 years, Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme performed just as well if not better, and that doesn't mean it has intrinsic value. With gold at least I can make a watch or fix my teeth with it. With Bitcoin I can do nothing but convince other people to pump my bags.

Thought I would share some buttcoiner cope since the recent cockyness has reached near unbearable levels after the bubble serge.",FuzzyLogic36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1hata2a/new_buttcoin_lore_just_dropped/,2024-12-10 04:09:42,1,title,0.0,0.069,0.831,0.1,0.7273

Understanding Common Cryptocurrency Terms and Concepts
------------------------------------------------------

Cryptocurrency can be a tricky domain to navigate, especially if you're just getting started. Understanding the basic terms and concepts is essential for anyone looking to dive into this digital asset space. This knowledge will empower you to make informed decisions as you venture into the world of crypto.

### What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (known as fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized technology called blockchain. This technology ensures transparency and security, making it difficult to alter or counterfeit transactions.

### Key Terms You Should Know

- **Blockchain:** The underlying technology behind most cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions. Each block contains multiple transactions, and once a block is filled, it is added to the chain, preserving the order of events.
- **Wallet:** A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. It can be software-based (online or mobile) or hardware-based (physical devices). Your wallet contains a pair of keys: a public key (like an address) and a private key (your password).
- **Exchange:** Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms where you can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. Some popular exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Remember to research the security features and fees associated with each exchange.
- **Altcoin:** Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is considered an altcoin. Examples include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. Altcoins might offer different features or functions compared to Bitcoin, making them unique in their own right.
- **Mining:** This is the process of validating transactions on the blockchain and adding them to the public ledger. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and in return, they earn cryptocurrencies as rewards.
- **Token:** Tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that represent an asset or a utility on a specific platform. Unlike coins like Bitcoin that operate on their own blockchain, tokens often rely on existing blockchains such as Ethereum.
- **Decentralization:** This principle means that no single entity controls the entire network. In cryptocurrency, decentralization helps secure the network from hacks and fraud as power and control are dispersed among many users.
- **Smart Contracts:** These are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically execute agreements once conditions are met, streamlining processes by eliminating intermediaries.

### Types of Cryptocurrency

Understanding the variety of cryptocurrencies can help you choose the right investments. Here are some common types:

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Coins:** These are standalone cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). They can be used as a means of exchange.
2. **Stablecoins:** These cryptocurrencies are pegged to a stable asset, usually a fiat currency, to minimize price volatility. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).
3. **Utility Tokens:** These provide users with access to a product or service, often within a specific ecosystem. For instance, Binance Coin (BNB) can be used to pay fees on the Binance exchange.
4. **Security Tokens:** These represent real-world assets and may also give holders rights to dividends or profits. They are generally regulated more rigorously than utility tokens.

### Common Concepts to Understand

Alongside the terms, certain concepts should be familiar to anyone entering the cryptocurrency space:

- **Market Cap:** This measure indicates the total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying its current price by the total number of coins in circulation.
- **Volatility:** Cryptocurrencies often face significant price fluctuations in short timeframes, which can be both a risk and an opportunity for traders.
- **FOMO and FUD:** Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) can drive people to buy into a rising market, while Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can lead to panic selling.
- **Halving:** A process tied to Bitcoin, halving occurs roughly every four years, reducing the reward given to miners. It can significantly impact Bitcoin's supply and price.

Understanding these terms and concepts can enhance your confidence as you start trading or investing in cryptocurrencies. With the right knowledge, you can navigate this booming digital currency landscape more effectively.

### Conclusion

Diving into the world of cryptocurrency can be both exciting and overwhelming, especially for beginners. By taking the essential steps to get started in crypto, you equip yourself with the foundational knowledge needed to navigate this dynamic landscape confidently. Whether it's creating accounts on trusted exchanges or ensuring you have a secure wallet, these initial actions will set you on the right path toward engaging with digital currencies.

Changpeng Zhao says it‚Äôs ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô for China to build a BTC reserve,"Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, stated at the Bitcoin MENA conference on December 9 that it is ""inevitable"" for China to build a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in the future. While discussing the likelihood of countries adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Zhao suggested that smaller nations might lead the way, with China eventually following suit. However, he noted that predicting China‚Äôs crypto policies is challenging due to the government‚Äôs lack of transparency.

Zhao, who has extensive experience with both Chinese and global markets, highlighted that while he hadn‚Äôt seen any direct evidence of China hoarding Bitcoin, the country‚Äôs need for a ""hard"" asset would likely push it toward establishing a Bitcoin reserve. He emphasized that such a move could happen quickly once the Chinese government decides to act, particularly as Bitcoin becomes an increasingly significant asset for nations seeking to hedge against fiat currency risks.

The conversation also touched on the possibility of the U.S. government, under an incoming administration, adopting a similar strategy, which was proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. If implemented, such a reserve could potentially drive Bitcoin‚Äôs price up significantly due to the purchasing of large quantities of BTC.

Zhao‚Äôs comments reflect a broader trend in global discussions on how countries are increasingly considering Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as part of their financial strategies. However, the full extent of China‚Äôs involvement remains to be seen due to its historical secrecy around cryptocurrency matters.",Actual_Ad_5440,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1havbmn/changpeng_zhao_says_its_inevitable_for_china_to/,2024-12-10 06:08:55,1,title,0.0,0.023,0.94,0.037,0.4019

The reason crypto will never be used as a currency or widely accepted,"I posted this in another thread in another subreddit.

\------------

The problem with this is every time you spend, it's taxable. That's annoying. This is the red flag with crypto.

People are not going to keep track of 100 purchases for food with anything so they can spend all day doing taxes because they bought lunch with Litecoin.

\------------

  
For all the greatness of it, having to keep track of everything you buy for tax season is a deal breaker.  For likely everyone.  I'm sure there will be an app that does this for you, but still.  What a pain.

Imagine EVERYTHING YOU BUY has to be shared at tax time.  Yeah right.  Those people who buy lunch every day, that's like 200 purchases a year at least.  Plus groceries, rent, books, whatever.  No way are people going to keep track of that.  It's literally not going to happen.

It has nothing to do with them being too unsteady to be a currency (hey guys my currency is up 80% this year) even though that's another reason it won't be a currency.  It's simply because of taxes.

I haven't even sold any, ever, because I do not want to do the taxes, and because I am unsure how to even find my cost basis for something I bought on Binance US 5 years ago.  The app sure doesn't tell me.

I cannot even imagine using it every day and declaring that for taxes.

Oh, and it's slow.  Except Litecoin and I'm sure some new ones.  Bitcoin is slow.  Ethereum is expensive.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Can I have my sandwich soon?  As soon as your BTC transfers.  In 15 minutes.

Disclaimer: I'm bullish on crypto in general.  But this is entirely distinct from it being a form of money.

Disclaimer 2: I'm an entrepreneur who makes his entire living online, and I really want to accept crypto, but I cannot think of a reason that it would be better than money.  That has literally no reason to be used instead of money other than trendy factor and ""promoting adoption.""  More like annoying record keeping.

Got paid $4000 in BTC and then BTC fell 50%?  Now you owe taxes on a $4000 but you only have $2000 to pay it with.

The solution is to cash out immediately.  So then why even get paid in crypto?

There's no ease of use.",howevertheory98968,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hav9jc/the_reason_crypto_will_never_be_used_as_a/,2024-12-10 06:05:00,0,title,0.0,0.066,0.828,0.105,0.9635

"Nanocurrency Game Theory Analysis - Nano Arbitrage in Forex and Cryptocurrency Markets:
Why Nano (XNO) is Suited for Arbitrage:","*Nanocurrency could be paired with high-frequency trading to make billions of dollars worth in profit through arbitrage on the Forex currency and cryptocurrency markets. Nano is the best currency for this type of endeavor.*

**The Basic Fundamentals of Nanocurrency:**

1. Instant Transactions: Nano offers instant millisecond-level, feeless transactions due to its block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain. Nano's confirmation speed is very close to the speed of light. This allows for rapid buying and selling across exchanges without the delays associated with transaction times or fees, which is critical for arbitrage where timing is everything.
2. No Transaction Costs: Traditional cryptocurrencies often have fees that can erode arbitrage profits, especially for high-frequency trading. Nano's fee-less model means every cent of profit from price discrepancies can be retained, maximizing returns.
3. Scalability: Nano's design allows for high scalability without compromising speed or increasing costs, making it ideal for the volume of trades needed in arbitrage strategies. This scalability means that even as the network grows, the speed and cost benefits remain consistent.
4. Fixed Supply: With the total supply capped, Nano mimics the scarcity-driven value aspects of Bitcoin but without the energy consumption or transaction fee issues, potentially making it a stable but agile asset for quick trades.
5. Environmental Sustainability: Given Nano's energy-efficient ORV consensus, it's less likely to draw regulatory scrutiny for environmental reasons, ensuring longer-term viability for trading strategies.

**Game Theory Strategy for Arbitrage with Nano:**

* Objective: Use Nano's unique properties to exploit price differences across various markets, both crypto and forex, where Nano can act as a bridge currency.
* Players:
   * Arbitrageurs with Nano holdings.
   * Cryptocurrency exchanges.
   * Forex markets where Nano can be traded against other currencies or used in pairs.
* Strategies:
   * Cross-Exchange Arbitrage: Monitor Nano's price across different cryptocurrency exchanges. If there's a significant price difference, buy Nano on the exchange with the lower price and sell it on the one with the higher price. This requires simultaneous transactions or very quick sequential ones due to Nano's speed.
   * Forex Arbitrage: If Nano can be paired with major forex markets (like USD, EUR), look for discrepancies in the cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchange rates across different platforms or regions. Nano's instant transactions would facilitate rapid movement between forex and crypto markets.
   * Decentralized Exchange (DEX) vs. Centralized Exchange (CEX) Arbitrage: Exploit price differences between DEXs, which might have different liquidity pools or pricing mechanisms, and CEXs where traditional trading occurs.
* Equilibrium and Payoffs:
   * Efficient Market Hypothesis: In theory, these arbitrage opportunities should be short-lived as the market corrects itself. However, due to Nano's speed, an arbitrageur might capture these opportunities before they disappear, leading to significant profits.
   * Risks: If many arbitrageurs identify the same opportunity simultaneously, the profit margin could vanish quickly, or worse, lead to losses if the market moves adversely during transaction times.
* Counter-Strategies:
   * Market Makers: Could adjust their liquidity provision strategies to stabilize prices, reducing arbitrage opportunities.
   * Regulatory Bodies: Might implement measures if arbitrage leads to market manipulation or financial instability.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**

* Setting: Two major exchanges, Exchange A in New York and Exchange B in Tokyo, show a price discrepancy for Nano. On Exchange A, Nano is trading at $100, while on Exchange B, it's at $102.
* Execution:
   * An arbitrageur notices this discrepancy. They quickly transfer fiat or another cryptocurrency to Exchange A to buy Nano at $100.
   * Leveraging Nano's instant transaction capabilities, they then transfer the Nano (at nearly the speed of light) to Exchange B, where they sell it for $102.
   * This trade is executed within just a few seconds, before the market adjusts. Nano makes this possible.
   * Using Nano as the bridge currency can make this process faster for any type of arbitrage opportunities across multiple trading pairs.
* Outcome: After accounting for any conversion fees (which would be minimal or non-existent with Nano), the arbitrageur makes a $2 profit per Nano traded. If they have significant capital or use leveraged trading, this could scale to millions or billions if the price discrepancy persists or if similar scenarios are repeated across multiple exchanges or forex markets.
* Considerations:
   * Liquidity: Ensure enough liquidity on both ends to execute the trade without significant price slippage. Nano allows for an advantage with the lowest latency feeless method of liquidity re-balancing.
   * Regulatory Environment: Be aware of cross-border regulations that might impact the feasibility of such strategies.
   * Market Information: Constant monitoring of market data across multiple platforms is crucial.
   * Incentive: Running a node as a Principal Representative would provide an even greater edge, and an institution could use trading profits to maintain a high-performance node thereby further enhancing the whole network. Win-win. The zero-fee environment could increase arbitrage and trading profits that would offset running any node costs.

This scenario is theoretical, and actual implementation would depend on market conditions, regulatory environments, and the arbitrageur's access to real-time data and trading platforms. However, Nano's unique attributes position it as an exceptionally potent tool for such arbitrage opportunities. Exchanges that effectively implement many Nano trading pairs could see higher trading volumes over time and make more high-frequency trading profit as more traders and institutions implement their arbitrage strategies by taking advantage of Nanocurrency.

**Here is a deeper dive into the specific reasons why Nano (XNO) is particularly well-suited for arbitrage compared to traditional currencies or other cryptocurrencies:**

1. Zero Transaction Fees:

* Traditional Currencies: Forex arbitrage often involves transaction fees, wire transfer costs, and currency conversion fees, which can significantly cut into profits, especially in high-frequency trading where profits per trade might be minimal.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Most carry network fees (e.g., Bitcoin's transaction fees, Ethereum's gas fees) that not only reduce profit margins but can also slow down transaction times due to network congestion and known priority bumps.
* Nano: With no transaction fees, every arbitrage opportunity can be fully capitalized without the profit being diluted by costs. This is particularly beneficial for arbitrage where the profit margin might be thin. A robust prioritization mechanism ensures the most essential transactions are go through with priority without fees.

1. Instant Settlement:

* Traditional Currencies: Settlement times can range from minutes to days, depending on methods like SWIFT for international transfers, which is too slow for the rapid execution needed in arbitrage.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Even fast cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum can take minutes for confirmations, which can be a lifetime in the arbitrage world where opportunities last mere seconds.
* Nano: Transactions settle in milliseconds, providing the speed necessary to act on price discrepancies before they disappear. This instant finality ensures that the arbitrageur can lock in profits without delay.

1. High Scalability and Low Latency:

* Traditional Currencies: Scalability issues can arise with high volumes of transactions, leading to delays or higher costs.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Even scalable solutions like Ethereum with layer-2 scaling still have limits or costs associated with high transaction volumes.
* Nano: Designed for scalability, if Nano was scaled up with adoption, it can handle a high volume of transactions without significantly increasing latency or cost, making it ideal for high-frequency arbitrage where you might need to execute thousands of trades in a short period.

1. Fixed Supply and No Inflation:

* Traditional Currencies: Subject to inflation of the supply, which can erode the value of profits over time or change the profitability of holding currencies over time.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Nearly all cryptocurrencies have inflation of the supply through mining rewards or other mechanisms, which can affect long-term value. Fees can be uncertain which can erode the store of value.
* Nano: With a fixed supply and no inflation, the value of Nano held for even short periods isn't diluted, ensuring that the profit from arbitrage remains stable in terms of purchasing power. Each unit of account provides a perfect measurement. Nano has greater divisibility with 30 decimal places which allows for even the smallest conceivable amount of value to be accounted for.

1. Eco-Friendly:

* Traditional Currencies: Physical infrastructure and regulatory compliance can have environmental costs. According to available data, the global banking system consumes approximately 250 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, with the majority of this energy consumed by banking data centers.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Many, especially those using proof-of-work like Bitcoin, have significant energy consumption, potentially drawing regulatory scrutiny or public backlash. According to the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), Bitcoin currently uses around 120 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, which translates to roughly 328,767 megawatt-hours per day.
* Nano: Uses an Open Representative Voting (ORV) model with low energy requirements, reducing the risk of future regulatory penalties or restrictions that could affect trading strategies. Nano uses about 120kWh per day, or 50 megawatts per year. This means Nano is at least 2 million times more energy efficient than Bitcoin. By using Nano it would lower the overhead expense of the whole financial system.

1. Decentralization and Security:

* Traditional Currencies: While secured by central banks, they can be subject to geopolitical risks or banking crises. Centralized control makes them subject to manipulation, interference, and capital controls.
* Other Cryptocurrencies: Varying levels of decentralization; some might be more centralized or vulnerable to attacks. Nano is one of the most proven and time tested mainstream fully decentralized cryptocurrencies. With a fully distributed fixed supply and proven operational network, it has the lowest future ""end-game"" risk. There is less uncertainty and higher trust to continue to be sustainable for many hundreds of years into the future.
* Nano: The fully decentralized, 100% open network reduces counterparty risk in transactions. Its consensus mechanism is designed to prevent double-spending without the need for mining, making it secure for large, rapid transactions.

1. Ease of Cross-Border Transactions:

* Other Currencies: Cross-border transactions can be complex, involving multiple intermediaries, compliance checks, and time delays. Cross-border trades can still face regulatory hurdles or delays in certain jurisdictions.
* Nano: Fully decentralized and no intermediaries are needed for transactions, allowing for seamless, permissionless international arbitrage without the typical forex market frictions. There is no ""lightning network"" or other intermediary. Nano has the fastest (lowest latency transaction finality).

These characteristics make Nano uniquely positioned to exploit arbitrage opportunities in both forex and cryptocurrency markets, offering advantages in speed, cost, and operational efficiency that others do not match.",NanoisaFixedSupply,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanotrade/comments/1havq79/nanocurrency_game_theory_analysis_nano_arbitrage/,2024-12-10 06:35:46,1,title,0.0,0.06,0.812,0.128,0.9992

Is monero traceable?,"Monero (XMR) is fundamentally designed to be a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, making it **untraceable** by default. Here are the key features that contribute to its anonymity:

## Key Features of Monero's Privacy

- **Stealth Addresses**: Each transaction generates a unique one-time address for the recipient, ensuring that transactions cannot be linked to a specific user.

- **Ring Signatures**: This feature mixes the sender's transaction with multiple decoy transactions, obscuring the true origin of the funds and making it difficult to determine which transaction is legitimate.

- **Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)**: Introduced in 2017, this technology hides transaction amounts, further enhancing privacy by preventing observers from knowing how much was sent.

These mechanisms work together to ensure that all aspects of a Monero transaction‚Äîsender, receiver, and amount‚Äîare concealed from public view, providing a high level of anonymity compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where transactions are publicly traceable.

## Recent Developments and Concerns

Despite its strong privacy features, there have been discussions about potential vulnerabilities:

- **Chainalysis Research**: A leaked video from Chainalysis suggested that they might have developed methods to trace Monero transactions under certain conditions. However, this capability appears limited and does not negate the overall untraceability for most users.

- **Academic Studies**: Some research has explored weaknesses in Monero's privacy mechanisms, such as the ""10 Block Decoy Bug,"" which allowed for potential tracing but has since been patched.

While these developments indicate that Monero is not entirely immune to analysis, it remains one of the most private cryptocurrencies available. The consensus in the cryptocurrency community is that Monero transactions are still largely untraceable for the average user, maintaining its reputation as a secure and anonymous means of conducting transactions.",maxikaz19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1hawk9n/is_monero_traceable/,2024-12-10 07:34:08,1,title,0.0,0.06,0.9,0.039,-0.284

Am I crazy for going all-in on Bitcoin?,"I got into Bitcoin back in 2017. At first, I only bought a tiny bit‚ÄîI barely understood it. But in 2018-19, something clicked. I *finally* understood what Bitcoin truly is.

That‚Äôs when I got my first full Bitcoin. I started accumulating, one sat at a time. Today, I‚Äôve stacked over **9 BTC**, along with other assets in my portfolio. In total, my crypto holdings are worth over **$1,000,000**‚Äîbut my Bitcoin alone is worth less than that.

My goal is clear: **10 BTC** (or the magic **1 billion sats**). I‚Äôve never sold a single satoshi‚Äînot in the last bull cycle, not now, not ever. Some people call me stubborn. Others might say I‚Äôm insane. Maybe they‚Äôre right.

But deep down, I can‚Äôt shake this belief: Bitcoin is *the* thing. Everything else feels like noise.

Buying Modafinil Online: What You Need to Know For 2025,"Buying modafinil online in 2024 is a labyrinth. Gone are the days of easy searches and abundant user reviews, like in the heyday of DuckDose and ModafinilCat. These days, the market feels more underground, driven by word-of-mouth recommendations on forums and social media.On top of this, many vendors now exclusively accept cryptocurrency as a payment method, making it even harder for newcomers to navigate. Those that accept credit cards often come with hidden fees, making the process frustratingly opaque.After exploring numerous vendors, here‚Äôs a roundup of my experiences‚Äîwho stood out, who disappointed, and why Ninja Moda remains my top choice. 



  
1. Ninja Moda 

  
Overview: Ninja Moda has managed to carve a niche in this chaotic market. They‚Äôve overcome challenges like domain takedowns and have maintained a loyal customer base through consistent service and fair policies. 

  
Current URL: [ninjamoda.to](http://ninjamoda.to) 

  
My Experience: Unlike most vendors, Ninja Moda accepts both credit cards and crypto, with a 15% discount for crypto payments. This flexibility is a breath of fresh air in a market dominated by crypto-only options. Their shipping is reliable, and their packaging is discreet‚Äîideal for international buyers like me. 

  
Payment Methods: Credit cards and cryptocurrencies (15% discount for yspjcrypto). 



  
2. TrueModa 

  
Overview: TrueModa tries to position itself as a premium vendor, emphasizing product quality and ‚Äúsecure transactions.‚Äù However, their insistence on crypto-only payments creates unnecessary hurdles for many buyers. 

  
Concerns: While their product quality is decent, TrueModa‚Äôs customer support is unresponsive. If there‚Äôs a problem with your order, you‚Äôre on your own. 

  
My Experience: I placed a test order with TrueModa and received my package after three weeks‚Äîa long wait, even in this market. The lack of tracking updates made the experience stressful. 

  
Payment Methods: Cryptocurrencies only. 



  
3. ModaPulse 

  
Overview: ModaPulse comes across as a sleek and modern vendor, appealing to younger buyers. However, their reliance on crypto payments and lack of customer support hurt their credibility. 

  
Concerns: They advertise ‚Äústeep discounts,‚Äù but these are exclusively for bulk orders paid in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Smaller orders are significantly overpriced. 

  
My Experience: My experience with ModaPulse was underwhelming. While my order eventually arrived, the delivery took longer than promised, and I couldn‚Äôt get answers from their support team. 

  
Payment Methods: Cryptocurrencies only (10% discount for bulk orders). 



  
4. ZenModa 

  
Overview: ZenModa brands itself as the ‚Äúmindful choice‚Äù for modafinil buyers. While their marketing is compelling, their actual service leaves a lot to be desired. 

  
Concerns: ZenModa insists on crypto payments, which is fine if you‚Äôre familiar with the process. But for newcomers, it‚Äôs a barrier. They also lack transparency around shipping times, leaving you guessing when your order will arrive. 

  
My Experience: The product quality was fine, but the overall experience felt frustrating. ZenModa‚Äôs focus on crypto-first policies makes them less accessible to a broader audience. 

  
Payment Methods: Cryptocurrencies only. 



  
5. SwiftModa 

  
Overview: SwiftModa makes big promises about fast delivery, but their crypto-only payment system and limited regional reach make them unreliable for international buyers. 

  
Concerns: SwiftModa shines in select countries but struggles with customs and delivery delays elsewhere. Their customer service is polite but ineffective, often blaming ‚Äúcustoms issues‚Äù for delays. 

  
My Experience: I tried SwiftModa on a recommendation but wouldn‚Äôt repeat the experience. While the package eventually arrived, the two-week delay and lack of updates were frustrating. 

  
Payment Methods: Cryptocurrencies only (5% discount for Bitcoin). 

  
\---The Verdict--- 

After trying these vendors, Ninja Moda stands out for its balanced approach to me personally While others cater almost exclusively to crypto users, Ninja Moda offers flexibility with both credit card and crypto options. Their reliability, competitive pricing, and responsive support make standout to me in this challenging market.

"tldr; Concerns are growing over the security of Satoshi Nakamoto's 1 million Bitcoin due to advancements in quantum computing. The earliest Bitcoin transaction format, pay-to-public-key (P2PK), exposes public keys, making them vulnerable to quantum attacks that could derive private keys. Some propose freezing Satoshi's coins to prevent exploitation, but this raises debates about Bitcoin's principles of decentralization and immutability. Freezing would require altering Bitcoin's consensus rules, a challenging task needing broad community agreement.

The Future of the Crypto World: Opportunities and Challenges,"The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving rapidly, transitioning from a niche market to a significant player in global finance. As blockchain technology matures and adoption increases, the future of the crypto world promises both innovation and disruption. Here are key trends and developments that could shape its trajectory.

**1. Mainstream Adoption**

Cryptocurrencies are moving beyond speculation into practical use cases. Companies like Tesla, PayPal, and Visa have integrated crypto payments, and nations such as El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. In the future, more governments and corporations are likely to embrace cryptocurrencies, particularly as regulatory frameworks become clearer.

**2. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

Central banks worldwide are exploring CBDCs, which could redefine the relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. While CBDCs are not decentralized, their introduction may normalize the use of digital currencies and encourage widespread blockchain adoption.

**3. DeFi Expansion**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are revolutionizing how financial services operate. By removing intermediaries, DeFi provides global, accessible, and transparent alternatives to traditional banking systems. As DeFi projects mature, they could further challenge conventional finance, particularly in underserved regions.

**4. Environmental Concerns and Sustainable Cryptocurrencies**

The environmental impact of energy-intensive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has sparked debates. Future cryptocurrencies might prioritize eco-friendly proof-of-stake mechanisms or innovative solutions like carbon offsets to attract environmentally conscious users and investors.

**5. Increased Regulation**

Regulation will play a critical role in shaping the crypto industry. While stringent laws could limit innovation, clear guidelines may also foster trust and stability, encouraging broader adoption among retail and institutional investors.

**6. Integration with AI and IoT**

Combining cryptocurrencies with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) could unlock new possibilities. Smart contracts could automate complex transactions between devices, enabling seamless machine-to-machine payments in smart cities and other advanced infrastructures.

**7. Security and Fraud Prevention**

As crypto adoption grows, so do concerns about hacking, fraud, and scams. Enhanced blockchain security, including advanced cryptographic techniques and AI-driven fraud detection, will be crucial for maintaining trust in the ecosystem.

**8. Cultural Impact and Digital Assets**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have introduced blockchain to the art and entertainment sectors, creating new avenues for creativity and ownership. In the future, NFTs and similar technologies could expand into industries like real estate, gaming, and identity verification.

**9. Global Economic Shifts**

The role of cryptocurrencies in global finance is likely to increase, especially in countries with unstable economies or limited banking infrastructure. Crypto assets could serve as a hedge against inflation and provide access to global markets.

**Conclusion**

The crypto world stands at the crossroads of innovation and regulation. While challenges like environmental concerns and security remain, the potential for decentralization, financial inclusion, and technological breakthroughs makes it one of the most transformative phenomena of our time. As the industry evolves, keeping pace with developments and leveraging advanced tools like [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsDayTraders/comments/1gbvh06/tradingview_premium_free_edition_desktop_pc/) for market analysis will be essential for navigating this dynamic landscape.",kierantj655,https://www.reddit.com/r/PepeForex/comments/1hayis9/the_future_of_the_crypto_world_opportunities_and/,2024-12-10 10:04:50,1,title,0.0,0.043,0.767,0.19,0.9966

Ava Labs CEO Calls to Freeze Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoin Over Quantum Threats,"üö® Crypto News: The Ava Labs CEO, Emin G√ºn Sirer, drops a bombshell by proposing the freezing of Satoshi Nakamoto's legendary 1.1M $BTC stash. Why? He warns of growing quantum computing abilities that could exploit vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's early wallet cryptography, particularly the Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) format.  

Satoshi's coins, which used this legacy format, are considered sitting ducks for future quantum attacks, posing a potential risk to the crypto ecosystem. Some critics argue this move threatens the very foundation of crypto‚Äîimmutable ownership. Others speculate if this decision could lure Satoshi out of hiding.

While the quantum buzz grows‚Äîfueled by Google‚Äôs Willow quantum chip‚Äîindustry insiders remind us that current systems aren't yet capable of cracking Bitcoin encryption. Still, the underlying message is clear: proactive defense is key in this rapidly advancing tech space.

What do you think‚Äîshould Satoshi's stash be frozen or left untouched as a piece of crypto history? Let the debate begin.

Unlocking the Full Potential of Our BTC Holdings.,"Many of us have been holding Bitcoin, hoping to capitalize on its trends during this bull run, which shows great potential. This has left me wondering how to maximize the value of my holdings. Personally, I‚Äôm considering leveraging the BGBTC event, but still thinking if it seems like a solid approach.  
  
Within our crypto community, this idea resonates with many, though some may still be unaware of the program. To bridge that gap, a brief explanation might help shed light on its potential benefits and spark meaningful discussions about the opportunities it offers.  
  
The BGBTC event on Bitget is designed to provide BTC holders with a range of advantages. These include staking BTC to earn consistent rewards, accumulating BGPoints redeemable for future token airdrops, and settlement at favorable current market rates, with the program concluding on January 8th. Additionally, it can be used as loan collateral or margin for futures trading, allowing for diversified investment strategies and more.  
  
Discussing this as a group and complementing it with individual research could open significant doors for some of us. Let‚Äôs share our opinions on this initiative as everyone has a unique perspective on events like this.

WH Alliance has ripped me off. Beware,"My dad asked me to invest $5,000 in a platform called WH Alliance, promising 200% returns. After checking, I noticed the website was just a shell with little info, and the communication seemed like a copy-paste MLM scheme.

He claimed he was trading through Charles Schwab and that the platform didn‚Äôt have access to his account.

"Hi /u/nimble2, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

The USD used to be ""hard capped"" by the amount of gold the US had in storage until it was removed from the gold standard by President Nixon in 1971.

My opinion is that the power of greed will ultimately force a situation that may one day change the 21 million hard cap.

I have been around crypto and bitcoin for a few 4 year cycles now.  I'm not an expert at any of this but I have been around long enough to know a thing or to.

Some people might be shocked to find out that BTC is NOT a static trading environment.   It has DEVs.  It can and has been forked.  It can be changed.  Of course any proposed changes have to be voted on and approved.  So maybe, one day, the hard cap might be adjusted.",2FastMiner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hb1onq/can_the_21_million_btc_hard_cap_ever_be_adjusted/,2024-12-10 13:25:57,0,title,6.0,0.072,0.884,0.044,0.1027

WenBullRun Guide to Crypto Market Trends,"Hey all, this is a follow-up post from one month ago on **WenBullRun**, a [**one-stop dashboard for degen market research**](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1ghulnb/wen_bull_run_i_built_a_onestop_dashboard_for/)

I've recently had the time to write a short guide on how you can get the pulse of the crypto markets in ten to twenty seconds (see original article with images published on my [**substack**](https://www.0xblockbard.com/p/wenbullrun-guide-to-crypto-market) here).

Hope this will be useful to some:

[WenBullRun](https://wenbullrun.com/)¬†is designed for busy (or lazy) working professionals who find it challenging to stay on top of fast-moving crypto markets amid their demanding nine-to-five grind.

By spending just about ten to twenty seconds a day, you can quickly gauge the overall market trend using our set of key indicators displayed in a dashboard style.

However, please note that WenBullRun is not intended to replace your own thorough research into individual projects and blockchains.

Instead, it should serve as a helpful complement to your existing efforts.

Ultimately, informed decision-making requires diligent study on your part. Consider this tool as a starting point for each day ‚Äî a concise snapshot of the current state of the crypto landscape.

# Key Indicators

Below are the primary indicators WenBullRun tracks. Each one provides a different perspective on market conditions, and together, they can help you better understand the broader trends at play.

* **Price Action (BTC/ETH/SOL)** We provide current prices and historical comparisons over 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day periods. Observing how these leading assets move over various time frames can help you understand whether the market is in an uptrend, downtrend, or moving sideways.
* **Market Dominance (BTC/USDT/ETH/SOL)** Market dominance measures the relative share of total market capitalization held by specific assets. Shifts in dominance can reveal changing investor preferences‚Äîfor example, if Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance decreases, it may suggest growing interest in alternative assets.
* **Fear & Greed Index** This index is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behaviour. A value of 100 represents maximum greediness, and a value of 0 signals maximum fear. You can gauge whether the market is leaning toward optimism or caution by comparing current sentiment to historical highs, lows, and averages (7, 30, and 90 days).
* **Quarterly Crypto Venture Capital (VC) Data** Tracking the volume and number of VC deals each quarter provides insights into the level of institutional and corporate interest in crypto. Periods with increased funding may indicate renewed confidence, while declining figures could suggest a more conservative environment.
* **Google Trends Data** Monitoring worldwide search interest in terms like ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù, ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù, ‚ÄúSolana‚Äù, ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù, and ‚Äúweb3‚Äù over the past five years helps identify shifts in broader public attention. An increase in search activity may coincide with rising interest from new market participants, while subdued activity might indicate a lack of general enthusiasm.
* **Coinbase App Ranking** Tracking the Coinbase app‚Äôs position in major app store rankings offers a proxy for retail engagement. Historically, surges in ranking have aligned with heightened public interest and sometimes market peaks. By keeping an eye on this metric, you can gain insights into when retail participation may be reaching critical levels or, conversely, when they may be starting to lose steam.

# How to Interpret Google Trends Data

Google Trends normalizes search interest to a scale where each term‚Äôs highest point over the selected timeframe (e.g. five years) is set to 100, and all other values represent relative interest compared to that peak.

This means a score of 50 indicates the term‚Äôs popularity was half of its maximum level, not that the search volume halved.

Keep in mind that these figures reflect relative rather than absolute volumes and vary based on the time period and region selected.

* **A value of 100**¬†indicates the highest level of interest for the term during the past five years.
* **A value of 75**¬†means that the term‚Äôs popularity is three-quarters of its peak value.
* **A value of 50**¬†means that the term‚Äôs popularity is half of its peak value.
* **A value of 25**¬†means that the term‚Äôs popularity is one-quarter of its peak value

It‚Äôs important to note that these values are specific to each individual search term. For example, a value of 70 for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù is not directly comparable to a value of 50 for ‚ÄúEthereum,‚Äù because each is measured against its own historical peak.

What you can do is observe the general trend within each individual search term or observe and compare the general trend across different search terms to see if the general interest in crypto is rising or decreasing.

If several key terms all show increasing values over the past 30, 90, and 180 days, this may indicate growing mainstream awareness or participation.

# General Interpretation of Key Indicators

No single indicator can fully explain market behaviour. Instead, consider how these metrics interact to form a coherent picture.

For instance, if price trends appear positive while the Fear & Greed Index shows increasing optimism, and the Coinbase app is climbing in the rankings, the market may be nearing a period of heightened speculative activity.

Conversely, flat or declining prices combined with reduced search interest and stablecoin dominance might suggest a more cautious environment.

In practice, use these indicators as a guide‚Äîa way to quickly assess where the market may be heading.

While WenBullRun simplifies and streamlines your initial market check-in, remember that making thorough investment decisions still calls for more detailed research.

These indicators serve as a helpful starting point when you need a quick check on the market‚Äôs pulse, not a definitive answer.

>**Key Reminder:**  
Use WenBullRun to streamline your research, not replace it ‚Äî insight demands effort

That said, there are some general heuristics for when we are moving to a bull run or bear market:

# General Signs of a Coming Bull Run

Look for a combination of these signals appearing together:

* **Increasing Greed on the Fear & Greed Index (Trending above 65):**¬†As the Fear & Greed Index starts to lean more towards Greed, it may indicate that investors are ready to take on more risk by entering the market. This psychological shift often precedes increased market activity and investment.
* **Rising Bitcoin Price and Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance:**¬†Widely regarded as a store of value and a benchmark asset in crypto, an increase in Bitcoin's price coupled with declining dominance often reflects rising demand for Bitcoin while also signalling that investors are reallocating capital into altcoins to chase higher yields, indicating broader market confidence.
* **Decreasing Tether Dominance:**¬†A reduction in funds parked in stablecoins represents growing investor confidence. It demonstrates that traders are moving away from conservative, low-yield assets and becoming more willing to deploy capital into higher-risk, potentially higher-reward crypto investments.
* **Increasing Social Trend:**¬†Heightened search interest in crypto-related terms and increased Coinbase app installs on the App Store are leading indicators of broader market engagement. These metrics reflect growing retail investor awareness and anticipation of potential price movements.

When these conditions align, it often indicates that the market may be transitioning into a bullish phase.

In such environments, altcoins frequently benefit as capital flows out from Bitcoin and stablecoins, seeking higher returns in other projects.

# Take Profits Gradually through Dollar-Cost Averaging

As the market shows signs of a bull run with the above signals, it's a good time to start DCA-ing out profits from crypto that you have accumulated during the bear market.

By systematically taking profits as prices rise, you lock in gains without attempting to time the market perfectly. This disciplined approach reduces emotional decision-making and ensures you benefit from market euphoria before a potential downturn.

If you haven‚Äôt invested much during the previous periods, you can still ride the momentum of the bull run while learning to accumulate and sell strategically for the next cycle.

>**Key Reminder:**  
Profits are made in buying, and not selling.

# Signs of a Coming Bear Run

On the other hand, here are some warning signals that could signal a potential market downturn and an incoming bearish phase:

* **Increasing Fear on the Fear & Greed Index (Trending below 50):**¬†As the index shifts towards fear, it reflects growing investor pessimism and uncertainty. This psychological state often triggers a collective move towards more conservative investment strategies, with participants seeking to minimize potential losses.
* **Stagnating or Increasing BTC Dominance:**¬†An increase or prolonged plateau in Bitcoin dominance typically signals that investors are retreating from riskier altcoins. This flight to Bitcoin's relative stability suggests a broader market defensive strategy, with participants prioritizing capital preservation over speculative gains.
* **Stagnating or Increasing Tether Dominance:**¬†Growing capital allocation to stablecoins indicates a pronounced risk-averse environment. Traders are effectively moving to the sidelines, preserving capital and awaiting clearer market conditions or potential buying opportunities during market corrections.
* **Decreasing Socials Trend:**¬†A decline in crypto-related search terms, app installs, and overall digital engagement serves as a leading indicator of waning market enthusiasm. This reduced public interest suggests diminishing retail investor participation and reduced market momentum in general.

These indicators collectively point toward a risk-off market environment. During such periods, altcoins are particularly vulnerable, often experiencing more significant price swings and value erosion as traders reallocate to more stable assets.

# Accumulate Gradually as the Market Bottoms in Fear

During bear markets, as signalled by the indicators above, and especially when fear reaches its peak, and there is widespread hopelessness and lots of red in the markets... this is often the ideal opportunity to begin DCA-ing and accumulating your favourite crypto assets with strong fundamentals.

And while it‚Äôs nearly impossible to time the absolute bottom of the market, you can use a declining Fear & Greed Index (e.g. trending below 55) as a rough guide to identify potential entry points to start accumulating.

By spreading your purchases across the downturn, you mitigate the risk of catching falling knives and position yourself to benefit from eventual recoveries over the medium to long term.

**Caveat:**¬†This is a long-term strategy that requires patience and discipline. Markets may take months or even years to recover, so it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a long-term outlook and avoid reacting emotionally to short-term volatility.

>**Key Reminder:**  
The time to buy is when there is blood in the streets, even if it‚Äôs your own.

# Bitcoin Dominance Cycle Chart

Here‚Äôs a summary of some common Bitcoin dominance trends and patterns in the chart below.

Do keep in mind that crypto markets are highly volatile, and while these patterns can provide some insights, outcomes may vary.

Always exercise caution and consider multiple factors when analyzing market trends.

# Limitations of These Indicators

While the indicators and signals provided by WenBullRun can offer valuable insights into prevailing market conditions, it is essential to understand their inherent limitations.

These metrics are trend-based tools that assume relatively stable market environments. Under normal circumstances, they help you form a general view of the market‚Äôs direction, but they are not predictive models that guarantee future outcomes.

In particular, these indicators cannot account for unforeseen ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù events‚Äîrare and unpredictable occurrences that can dramatically alter market dynamics.

Examples might include major geopolitical conflicts, significant political events such as another assassination of Donald Trump, large-scale natural disasters, sudden regulatory crackdowns on crypto, or, conversely, transformative developments like countries adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

Such events can lead to abrupt shifts in market sentiment, liquidity, and prices, rendering previously reliable indicators less meaningful in the short term. Indicators may swing dramatically between extremes, and well-established patterns could temporarily break down, creating a climate of heightened volatility and uncertainty.

As a result, it is crucial to treat these tools as just one part of your decision-making process.

Always complement indicator-based insights with your own research, careful judgment, and an awareness that markets can and do surprise even the most informed observers.

# Conclusion

WenBullRun provides a quick overview of key market indicators to help you gauge overall crypto market sentiment and trends within just ten to twenty seconds.

While this tool can streamline your initial market check-in, it‚Äôs important to remember that the indicators presented here are only one part of a larger puzzle.

Use them as a starting point to understand where things might be heading, but always supplement with deeper research, monitoring current events, and assessing fundamental project developments.

Market dynamics are influenced by a wide range of factors, and no single tool or indicator can fully capture every nuance‚Äîparticularly during periods of sudden, unexpected change.

By recognizing both the value and the limitations of these indicators, you can better integrate them into a comprehensive approach to navigating the crypto landscape.

Ultimately, WenBullRun aims to assist, not replace, the thoughtful work you put into making informed crypto investment decisions.",0xBlockBard,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1hb3d16/wenbullrun_guide_to_crypto_market_trends/,2024-12-10 14:46:56,1,title,0.0,0.049,0.827,0.124,0.9986

Gryphon Digital Mining ($GRYP) Secures Agreement for Natural Gas Assets to Power Growth,"Came across some cool news that I thought I'd share!  
  
Gryphon Digital Mining has announced a definitive agreement to acquire natural gas assets in Northeast British Columbia, Canada. The assets, currently in insolvency, include over 5 trillion cubic feet of contingent natural gas resources and infrastructure capable of processing 140 million cubic feet per day. This acquisition marks a critical step for Gryphon as it seeks to secure low-cost, scalable energy solutions for its bitcoin mining and AI operations.

The project will initially generate 100 megawatts (MW) of power, with potential expansion to 1 gigawatt (GW). Gryphon anticipates energy production costs of less than $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (KWH), providing a cost-efficient foundation for powering its operations. The site also offers opportunities for environmental initiatives, including greenhouses to offset emissions and supply fresh produce to northern communities.

While the agreement reflects Gryphon‚Äôs commitment to innovative energy solutions, it remains subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions. The acquisition highlights Gryphon‚Äôs strategy to develop differentiated power sources that support long-term growth in both bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure.

LNG shipping stocks: Another volatile week and insights for the road ahead,"# Summary

The UP World LNG Shipping Index (UPI), tracking listed LNG shipping companies, declined 0.56% last week, closing at 162.48 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.96%. Despite this overall dip, the sector showed varied performance among individual stocks. Exmar NV surged 34.7% due to renewed privatisation interest, while New Fortress Energy rose 16.3% on reduced debt concerns. Conversely, Cool Company and Flex LNG suffered double-digit losses, reflecting broader challenges.

Geopolitical turbulence, including South Korea's brief martial law and Chinese manoeuvres near Taiwan, failed to sway global markets significantly. The sector faces a first ""mature crisis,"" with investor caution likely persisting until spring. However, strategic management actions, such as debt restructuring and adapting to market trends like the phase-out of steam-powered tankers, will be pivotal in navigating these headwinds. Despite these challenges, the critical role of LNG shipping in global energy supply continues to grow.	

# UPI & SPX 

Last week, the UP World LNG Shipping Index (UPI), which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 0.91 points, equivalent to 0.56%, closing at 162.48 points. The S&P 500 index gained 0.96%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data. 

[Week 50-2024: Chart of the UP World LNG Shipping Index with S&P 500 \(Source: UP-Indices\)](https://preview.redd.it/zxhym1y3f16e1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f8fbb02d14ab4b1824e307702a57491a288e25b)

# Broader view 

Last week was rich in geopolitical events. The six-hour martial law in South Korea, the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the fall of the government in France and the new Chinese manoeuvres in Taiwan have shown that the stability of our world is very fragile. But stock markets are spectacularly ignoring these events, with bitcoin breaking the much-vaunted $100,000 mark.

In our regular Chart of the Week, we lamented that the main problem with our sector of interest is the diversion of investors who see attractive opportunities elsewhere and leave the sector's stocks aside until the next dividend. We conditioned this scepticism on crossing the long-term moving average with the UPI. After updating the data, the UPI and MA40 (forty-week moving average) are the same. At the same time, the traded volume of the stock is still low. So, what was the week's performance for single-stock companies?

# Constituents 

The events could be briefly summarised as follows: It could have been worse. UPI's relatively tiny loss is due not only to a few rising titles but mainly to several undecideds.

Cool Company (NYSE/OSE: CLCO) was the biggest loser, continuing its downtrend. It lost 10.4% last week. Second is another Norwegian company, Flex LNG (NYSE/OSE: FLNG), which lost 9.2% and broke its long-term support at $25.

The third Norwegian company, Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG), is down 6.7%. While both CLCO and ALNG cut the dividend, FLNG did not.

Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) lost 6.2%, similar to ALNG. However, its decline came after the resolution of the domestic political crisis.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) fell 4.1%, though this partnership is at its highest level since 2019. However, due to sector developments, the last three weeks have also failed to break higher.

A trio of gas and oil producers also fell. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) lost the most, writing off 4.1%. Shell (NYSE: SHEL) lost 2.3%, and BP (NYSE: BP) lost 2.1%. The irony here is that the minor losses from last week are the biggest threats to the stock. SHEL and BP are in a downtrend, respectively, and BP appears to be starting a new downtrend phase.

The companies hovering around zero are indecisive to positive. Undecided stocks include Capital Clean Energy Carriers (NYSE: CCEC) and Tsakos Energy Navigation (NYSE: TEN), while Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) has staved off efforts for a larger decline.

The clear winner is Exmar NV (BSE: EXM), up 34.7%. This is due to the majority owner's renewed interest in privatising the company.

New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ: NFE) is rising thanks to positive developments. Investors have lost their concerns about the company's debt, which it wants to reduce through the participation of other partners. Last week, the stock rose 16.3%.

Golar LNG (NASDAQ: GLNG) continues to rise after a break; this time, the weekly gain was 7.8%.

Excelerate Energy (NASDAQ: EE), another of the previous movers, on the other hand, is taking a break, rising just 1.1%, with intraday moves both to the plus and minus side.

We'll also mention Malaysia's MISC (KLSE: 3816), which added 2.6% after returning to the previous supports we wrote about earlier.

# Crystal Ball

What is our outlook for the immediate future? We anticipate a continued decline in the UPI through the remainder of the year, primarily driven by investor behaviour. Many seem likely to patiently await further drops in LNG shipping sector stocks before re-entering the market, likely no earlier than spring. This caution is unsurprising, given the multitude of external factors at play.

One notable trend on the horizon is the accelerated phasing out of steam-powered tankers‚Äîan inevitable development given the current lower spot rates. However, as highlighted in today's commentary, a broader decline in the UPI does not necessarily spell losses for all companies. Management's actions, particularly in debt refinancing already underway at several firms, will be critical in determining individual outcomes.

It is fair to say that the sector is facing its first mature crisis‚Äîexcluding the covenant decline‚Äîand this is the moment for management to prove the value they bring to shareholders.

Anthony Scaramucci predicts China to create strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025,"üö® Crypto News: Anthony Scaramucci has stirred the crypto pot with a bold prediction‚ÄîChina might reenter the $BTC mining game and even integrate Bitcoin into its reserve assets by 2025. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference, Scaramucci hinted that as the US warms up to Bitcoin, the geopolitical chessboard is shifting, leaving other nations with little choice but to reconsider their stance.

The idea of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is gaining traction globally. Russia has toyed with the notion of a national Bitcoin reserve to mitigate sanctions, while Brazil is eyeing an $18.6 billion allocation for its reserves. Even US policymakers are increasingly open to the concept, with legislative proposals like Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs push to acquire a multi-year Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, corporate giants like BlackRock have signaled their backing for such initiatives.

With the 2024 Bitcoin halving and US elections on the horizon, $BTC is not just a speculative investment anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs proof-of-strategy for nations looking to boost financial resilience and assert global economic dominance. If Scaramucci‚Äôs prediction holds, China‚Äôs potential return to Bitcoin could be the ultimate plot twist in the race for digital asset supremacy.

My long term view of Hedera-HBAR,"My long term view on Hedera/HBAR:

People keep talking about loading up during the next bear market because they think the HBAR price is too high currently with the run up. 

But what I believe they don‚Äôt realize is that HBAR could run to $5-10 this cycle and only pull back to $1 as a next low in a bear market. 

This bear market was very bad due to all of the crypto fraud, government suppression, and unregulated markets.

When crypto goes mainstream in regulated markets during this run up, the cycles will be much different and operate more like stock markets due to all of the institutional and retirement money invested. 

In that context, even $0.33 HBAR is cheap, and you may never see that price again next year and beyond.

Those who understand what Hedera is doing are not going to sell any of the HBAR they purchased, and will only sell staking rewards as needed many years from now. 

Just look at the fully diluted market cap ($16.5 billion) and you will have your answer.

I believe this is going to be a multitrillion dollar token in 10-15 years.

If ETH can have $500 billion market cap with its flaws, and Bitcoin can have $2 trillion market cap by being used only as digital gold, HBAR can get to and possibly exceed $500 billion market cap in the next few years if the use cases start piling up. That means $10 HBAR.  Hedera network at high global utilisation, should make HBAR worth more than Bitcoin. Thus, $5 trillion market cap is not out of the question, which means $100 HBAR.

HBAR holdings are multigenerational wealth that will just keep growing in value as the price of HBAR continually increases due to fixed supply, while also providing income through staking rewards.  

The HBAR tokenomics are great. At least 2/3 of the 50 billion HBAR are required to be staked. Which means less than 1/3 of the HBAR will ever be in active circulation. That creates scarcity.

As network utilisation increases, the scarcity drives the price of HBAR up. Also, as network utilisation increases, the rewards will increase back up to the current max of 2.5%. 

I think the council will increase the rewards back up to 6.5% if sufficient network revenues are generated and to encourage staking to meet the 2/3 requirement.  

As such, I don‚Äôt plan to sell any of the HBAR I purchased, and will only sell rewarded tokens as needed.

Rich people don‚Äôt sell their core assets that grow significantly in value over time. They borrow against them and use income and dividends to pay back the interest and/or principal. 

I have been accumulating significantly on dips and plan on holding my purchases forever. The staking rewards alone at 2.5% when the network is highly utilised and the price of HBAR is over $3(likely much higher) will provide significant income for me to live off of. 

I will setup a multigenerational trust to provide income to the next generations in my family.

Residencey ,"Hello, I know that on December 17 all US users will be denied access from withdrawing from Kucoin and essentially their money will be lost. It states US residence, I am a US citizen, but I currently reside in Italy. Will I be able to change this residency so that I can avoid the penalty on December 17? I bought bitcoin on here a long time ago and forgot about it and now I just heard about this unfortunate situation. I read that I can download a new app like Coinbase and transfer my funds from Kucoin into Coinbase but honestly, I'm such a noob to this cryptocurrency stuff that I just want a safe way to either keep my money or take them out.

I don‚Äôt have a savings account because I‚Äôm a pretty good saver myself. I was told once that sitting money in a bank account is a horrible idea.. but then what do i do with it? I‚Äôm not paying rent .. bills.. or any loans. Thank God - but how do i increase my income? I have plans to build and educate youth - not only in the US but around the world as well. However, my plans to build wealth don‚Äôt include investing because i have 0 idea on how to do that. 

The only investing I know of is real estate - there‚Äôs actual evidence that that works. I have heard of bitcoin but clearly I can‚Äôt buy that as I have no money for that. What do i do? Is there an app to buy investments in? How does it work? Please someone teach me because i‚Äôm as lost as anything can be in this topic.

I think Elon Musk will throw official support for PEPE when the community is at least 1M+ investors. READ ‚¨áÔ∏è,"We all know Elon loves memes and is one of the main catalysts behind DOGE‚Äôs astronomical rise in price over the years. I also think he just likes to help the little guys make some money by pumping popular coins and PEPE is currently one of the hottest memecoins in the market. I predict that once we surpass 1M investors and once Trump is officially in office, Elon and the crypto market overall will trigger a historic bull run like never seen before. 

Reasons why I‚Äôm bullish on PEPE and will HODL:

1. Bitcoin halved and alt season isn‚Äôt even in full bloom yet

2. Trump admin is the most pro-crypto team ever and this will have massive, outsized positive effect on crypto markets 

3. Interest rates are going down, which means cheaper money and more incentive for people and businesses to spend again 

4. ETH will at least double in 2025 and this is great news for PEPE since it‚Äôs derived from ETH

5. When we overtake SHIB, market sentiment will drastically change and funds will divert to the more popular and hotter memecoin for 2025: PEPE!

6. PEPE has been doing impressive numbers in volume, investor base, and market cap growth with less than a month into being on major exchanges. We are still so early and millions have not yet heard of PEPE yet. Wait until they know, it will be the next FOMO action similar to Doge.

7. If Trump resolves the situation in Ukraine, that will lead to even more optimism around the world and that will have positive effects on all markets, stock and crypto. 

8. Last prediction: the final battle of memecoins will come down to DOGE vs PEPE and we all know who will win that one üòèüê∏


HAVE NO FEAR. DO NOT PANICK. HODL AND RIDE WITH US TO THE MOON!

Am I doing the right thing by DCAing into the stock market?,"I'm 38 and single. and I'm putting half of my take home pay each month into VOO and QQQ (around $3000). I've only started this month while the market is at all time high. I've been putting my savings into US Treasury bills for the last couple of years so I missed out on the market gains. Despite that, I believe I'm doing the right thing to start investing in the market even though it's ATH. I do have amassed quite a bit of cash due to savings from the last few years, but in order to cut down on market timing risk, I decided to DCA into the market from now on rather than lump sum it. I will just use the existing cash I have for emergency fund or as a down payment as a house later and keep it in US Treasury in the mean time. But pretty much most of my new income will mostly go toward VOO and QQQ and I don't plan on selling no matter what. (I got burned by selling some of my holdings in the 2022 downturn).

Am I doing the right thing?

Also would like to hear your opinion on Bitcoin as I believe Fidelity allows buying bitcoins now. Would DCAing into that make sense as well?

"> Am I doing the right thing by DCAing into the stock market?

Short answer: yes. 

> I‚Äôm putting half of my take home pay each month into VOO and QQQ (around $3000). 

Wow that‚Äôs impressive keep it up as long as you can. 

> I‚Äôve only started this month while the market is at all time high

Doesn‚Äôt matter 

> I‚Äôve been putting my savings into US Treasury bills for the last couple of years so I missed out on the market gains. 

Precisely. Learn your lesson, invest in the market. 

>Despite that, I believe I‚Äôm doing the right thing to start investing in the market even though it‚Äôs ATH. 

You are 

> I do have amassed quite a bit of cash due to savings from the last few years, but in order to cut down on market timing risk, I decided to DCA into the market from now on rather than lump sum it.

Statistically speaking lump sum beats DCA 2/3 of the time. But if you can‚Äôt psychologically stomach lump summing, DCA is perfectly fine. 

>But pretty much most of my new income will mostly go toward VOO and QQQ and I don‚Äôt plan on selling no matter what.

Consider adding some international diversification. Otherwise your strategy is perfect.

Never ‚ÄúHOLD‚Äù for too long with Shib or any other crypto except Bitcoin ,"This crypto world, especially shib is basically a gamble not an investment!

It's all about when you buy and you sell!

Was up 35% and didn't sell, then checked again and down to 10%..

Sold at 10% gain. I've been negative for the whole year but kept buying to bring my average down. At one point I was -55% down, then I bought it to -20%,then this ""bullrun"" I went up +35%!

My goal was to exit with 200% if lucky... but nope! Fell all the way down to 10% from 35%..

Before I felt like I was being smart by ""holding"" but now I just see this crypto shit as a gamble not a real investment, expect for Bitcoin.

If I had ""Hold"" I would be down -10% by now. Fuck that!

Whoever gets lucky in this crypto world are the ones who are just lucky... it doesn't really matter how long you've been holding. Someone could just buy one day or one hour before the next bull run and be up more than a person who's been ""holding""... you just never know when.

how to buy meme coins,"Buying meme coins is a relatively straightforward process, but it requires some knowledge of how to use cryptocurrency exchanges and manage your digital assets securely. Meme coins, like **Dogecoin (DOGE)**, **Shiba Inu (SHIB)**, and other newer tokens, are often purchased through both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs). Below is a step-by-step guide on how to buy meme coins:

# Step 1: Choose a Meme Coin to Buy

Before you start buying, decide which meme coin you want to purchase. Some of the most popular meme coins are:

* **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: One of the earliest and most well-known meme coins.
* **Shiba Inu (SHIB)**: A popular Dogecoin alternative with a large community.
* **Floki Inu (FLOKI)**: A meme coin inspired by Elon Musk's dog, named Floki.
* **Pepe Coin**: Another meme coin based on internet culture.
* **Solana-based meme coins**: These are meme coins built on the Solana blockchain, like **Kishu Inu** or **Hoge Finance**.

# Step 2: Choose an Exchange

Once you've decided on the meme coin, you need to select an exchange where you can buy it. Meme coins are available on both **centralized** and **decentralized** exchanges.

# Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

These platforms are user-friendly and offer a secure way to buy and trade meme coins. Some popular centralized exchanges include:

* **Binance**: A major exchange that lists popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
* **Coinbase**: A beginner-friendly platform where you can purchase meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
* **FTX**: A cryptocurrency exchange that may list meme coins and offers user-friendly features.
* **KuCoin**: Known for listing many altcoins, including meme coins, and offering a variety of trading pairs.

**How to buy on CEXs:**

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up on the exchange and complete any necessary identity verification.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Fund your account with fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.) or cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) by transferring funds from your bank or another crypto wallet.
3. **Search for the Meme Coin**: Use the search feature on the exchange to find the meme coin you want to buy.
4. **Place an Order**: Choose the amount of meme coin you want to purchase and place your buy order. You can usually place a market order (immediate purchase at the current price) or a limit order (purchase at a specific price).
5. **Store the Coin**: Once the transaction is complete, you can store your meme coin in the exchange's wallet or transfer it to your own wallet for added security.

# Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

If the meme coin you want to buy is not available on centralized exchanges, you can use a DEX. DEXs operate on blockchain networks and allow you to trade directly with other users. Popular DEXs for meme coins include:

* **Uniswap** (Ethereum-based tokens)
* **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain tokens)
* **Raydium** (Solana-based tokens)
* **Sushiswap** (Multi-chain support)

**How to buy on DEXs:**

1. **Set Up a Wallet**: Download a wallet like **MetaMask**, **Trust Wallet**, or **Phantom** (for Solana tokens). Make sure the wallet is compatible with the blockchain that the meme coin is built on (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, etc.).
2. **Add Funds to Your Wallet**: Transfer cryptocurrency (like Ethereum, Binance Coin, or Solana) to your wallet. You can buy crypto from a centralized exchange and then send it to your wallet address.
3. **Connect Your Wallet to the DEX**: Visit the DEX platform (e.g., Uniswap or PancakeSwap) and connect your wallet using the ""Connect Wallet"" button.
4. **Find the Meme Coin**: Search for the meme coin you want to buy by using its contract address (if necessary).
5. **Swap Tokens**: Choose the amount of cryptocurrency you want to trade for the meme coin and approve the transaction. Make sure to review the transaction details, including the gas fees (transaction fees).
6. **Confirm and Complete**: Once the transaction is confirmed, the meme coin will appear in your wallet.

# Step 3: Secure Your Meme Coins

Meme coins can be highly volatile, and it's crucial to secure your investments. Here are some tips for protecting your assets:

* **Use a Hardware Wallet**: For added security, consider transferring your meme coins to a hardware wallet like a **Ledger** or **Trezor**. These wallets store your keys offline, making them less vulnerable to hacking.
* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Always enable 2FA on exchanges and wallet apps to add an extra layer of security.
* **Backup Your Private Keys**: Keep a secure backup of your private keys and recovery phrases in case you lose access to your wallet.

# Step 4: Monitor Your Investment

Since meme coins can be very volatile, it's important to monitor your investment regularly. Keep an eye on price changes, news surrounding the meme coin, and community developments. Consider using crypto portfolio tracking apps to help stay organized.

# Step 5: Know the Risks

Meme coins are often highly speculative investments. They can see rapid price increases due to social media hype but are also prone to significant crashes. Be aware that meme coins can be subject to pump-and-dump schemes, and the market can be heavily manipulated. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

# Conclusion

Buying meme coins involves using a crypto exchange to swap your fiat or cryptocurrency for meme tokens. Whether you choose a centralized exchange like Binance or a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, make sure to use a secure wallet and understand the volatility involved. Always do your research before investing in meme coins and ensure you‚Äôre prepared for the risks.",Saddaf_Khan,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto2027/comments/1hb8xrs/how_to_buy_meme_coins/,2024-12-10 18:45:11,1,title,0.0,0.027,0.798,0.176,0.9993

People like to bash memecoins but what do top 100 coins do?,"Ive been on and off in crypto since 2017, people kept blabbering bout coin has to has utility and good team and so on for it to succeed but its been proven time and time again utility does not matter, all that matters is if a coin garners attention and are active in promoting it and all the cases of a crypto being successful is a case of supply and demand.

I was in a crypto facebook group back in 2017 that could not shut up about serious coins destined to be successful because of their utility and whatever whitepaper they have, most of which are dead now, anyone remmeber in 2021 or whenever that was when cryptos with NFT utility was the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù coins that now lost 90% of their value.

So i do not understand the hate on memecoins, anyone experience with crypto know 99% of coins created on pumpfun are rugpulls because of how easy it is to create a coin, but the age of serious coins and convincing people through usefulness and utility is over because lets face it crypto is never gonna be used in the real world as proven time and time again, the most that happens is some random cruiseship or a grocery store in thailand starts accepting bitcoin every bullrun.


The only thing that gives crypto any value is the demand for it and memecoins are where all the demand is nowadays, the only real reason to put ur money in any established coin with a huge market cap is for safety reasons, like protecting your assets behind a transparent team while experiencing some growths, the only reason some of the top coins are still alive is because theyre popular and old, some newcommers genuinely believe things like XRP can hit 1k lmao, speaking of XRP tell me one good reason XRP is the top 4 coin by market cap, it has been dead for years, the only coin i can think of that has real utility is monero for drug dealers on dark web.

If youre trying to make real money in crypto right now your only option is risking it on memecoins, being award of the rugpulls and still trying to get a lick, following trends, trends like spotify wrapped that only last one day or things christmas themed that last a season of if youre lucky a community driven coin like snakewifhat that work together to build something and try to make money together.

My point is lets not pretend most people care about a ‚Äúproject‚Äù all they care about is making money and memecoin communities are toxic and scammy but theyre transparent about one thing, a common interest in making money together, we are the fast age, crypto follows trends now and memecoins offer a way for trends to be capitalized, literally any event or meme or word thats happening is becoming a coin, you just have to know how to follow those trends and be smart to make money.




TLDR: basically the age of serious projects is over and boring, crypto has transformed in the last couple of years and is now and always has been only a volatile risky investment, a mean to make it big or lose, so lets not pretend not everyone here is not just trying to make money, because crypto is useless and inefficient in the real world.

"Marathon Digital boosts Bitcoin reserves by over 50% this quarter, nears $4 billion in holdings","üö® Crypto News: Marathon Digital is making some major Bitcoin moves! The mining giant has upped its $BTC reserves by over 50% this quarter, scooping up an eye-popping 11,774 BTC valued at around $1.1 billion. Earlier this month, they snagged another 6,484 BTC for $618 million, bringing their total holdings to a staggering 40,435 BTC, worth nearly $4 billion at the current spot price of $96,500.  

This aggressive accumulation cements Marathon's position as the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only behind MicroStrategy, the OG Bitcoin whale with over 420,000 BTC under its belt. Marathon's bullish strategy mirrors MicroStrategy's playbook, with a clear intent to dominate the Bitcoin market.  

Operationally, Marathon is crushing it too, boasting a quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 12.3% and a year-to-date yield of 47.6%. With impressive growth and a strong balance sheet, it‚Äôs no wonder Marathon‚Äôs stock ($MARA) ticked up over 2%, now trading at $24.18.  

Marathon is showing the world what long-term Bitcoin conviction looks like. Will this trigger more corporations to jump on the $BTC bandwagon? Time will tell.

Is trading labs trying to scam me?,"Okay so I think I got myself into a shitty situation with trading labs. So I joined their telegram and I decided to do their investment plan and so you basically send them money and they guarantee they will make it back to you with way more you invested in. Now just to be clear they have ‚Äúproof‚Äù of this working by showing deposits and withdraws linked to bitcoin accounts with the money sent to them after the process. I am very very new to trading and I am assuming this is called a CFD (Contract for Difference) now I could be wrong about that idk. But anyway I send the money and they tell me to make an account on a broker website called Wischoffspreads and to do the copy trading option for their name and I do so. So, they receive the money, and within 72 hours they had turned my $210 into around $10,000 which was already crazy from the little knowledge I know. (I was originally guaranteed $1,400 but I guess they made more I have no idea). So dude text me on telegram saying my trading session has ended and that I can withdraw so I do so or at least try to and there is a commission fee that has to be paid(20% of your profits that you have earned) which for me that would be been around 2k. And the platform Wischoffspreads is wanting me to send them 2k to their bitcoin address so they can begin the withdrawal process. And this whole time I‚Äôve been talking to my trade labs telegram guy asking questions about this and how I wasn‚Äôt told this upfront and he also ‚Äúassured‚Äù me that there is nothing to worry about. I don‚Äôt know. There is just a lot going on here and I am not sure what I need to do. I see the money on this platform which looks pretty legit and I have full access to it, deposits, withdraw, etc. Just can‚Äôt get it without paying this 20% fee bullshit on a completely separate transaction.

"Hi /u/too_many_shoes14, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Fake crypto wallet scam.

Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord.

In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim‚Äôs account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer‚Äôs wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Bitcoin wallet address here: https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports. If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer‚Äôs Ethereum wallet address here: https://info.etherscan.com/report-address/. You can see how much cryptocurrency has been sent to the scammer‚Äôs wallet address here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. Thanks to redditor nimble2 for this script.

PEPE market cap vs price ,"For everyone looking at price prediction for PEPE here is an idea of what market cap it can go to vs the price it would be at. 

Market cap vs price 
$10B: $0.0000238
$15B: $0.0000357
$20B: $0.0000475
$25B: $0.0000594
$30B: $0.0000713
$35B: $0.0000832
$40B: $0.0000951
$45B: $0.0001070
$50B: $0.0001189
$69B: $0.0001640
$100B: $0.000238
$1T: $0.00238
$4.2T: $0.01
$42T: $0.1

So for everyone talking about $0.1, the market cap would have to be $42 trillion‚Ä¶ meanwhile, bitcoins current market cap is $1.89T‚Ä¶ for perspective. 

I think (and this is my opinion only) we hit $100B at the top of this cycle purely on PEPE culture movement‚Ä¶ after that, there has to be a lot utility around PEPE to push it past ETH, XRP, SOL etc‚Ä¶ but I do think it will be the number 1 meme coin by 2025. If it can get that utility around it‚Ä¶ then it can fight those big names for their place.

Does Blackrock own more btc than Binance?,"## Bitcoin Holdings: BlackRock vs. Binance

BlackRock does not own more Bitcoin than Binance. In fact, Binance holds a significantly larger amount of actual Bitcoin in its reserves compared to BlackRock's holdings.

### Current Estimates

- **Binance**: 
  - Estimated Bitcoin Holdings: **665,482 BTC**
  - Binance is one of the largest holders globally.

- **BlackRock**: 
  - Estimated Bitcoin Holdings: **429,112 BTC**
  - BlackRock's holdings are primarily through investment products such as ETFs.

While BlackRock is a significant player in the cryptocurrency market through its ETFs and related products, these do not equate to direct ownership of physical Bitcoin like that held by Binance.

"tldr; Microsoft shareholders rejected a proposal to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet due to concerns about Bitcoin's volatility. The proposal, introduced by the National Center for Public Policy Research, suggested diversifying 1% of Microsoft's $78 billion in cash and marketable securities into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The company's board recommended rejecting the measure, emphasizing a preference for stable investments.

In the world of Bitcoin, transactions are the lifeblood. Every time you send or receive Bitcoin, you're tapping into a vast network of miners, nodes, and algorithms to ensure your digital cash makes its journey. But let‚Äôs face it: sometimes the journey feels like a road trip in a rusty old car stuck in traffic.

That‚Äôs where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** roars onto the scene! This turbocharged app is your golden ticket to fast-lane Bitcoin transactions. üöÄ Ready to zoom past the blockchain bottlenecks? Buckle up, and let‚Äôs dive in!

# The Dreaded Transaction Traffic Jam

Picture this: you‚Äôre at a coffee shop paying for your double mocha latte with Bitcoin. You scan the QR code, click send, and...wait. And wait. And wait. The barista is giving you the side-eye. Customers are tapping their feet. You‚Äôre sweating like you just ran a marathon, but the transaction‚Äôs still pending.

What gives?

The culprit: **network congestion**. Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain processes a limited number of transactions per block, and when demand spikes, transactions compete for attention.

# Why Do Transactions Get Stuck?

3. **Dust Transactions:** Transactions involving tiny amounts (a.k.a. ""dust"") are often deprioritized.

"Shiba Inu Fails to Break 9-Month Barrier, But New Investors See Potential","üö® Crypto News: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) faces a rough patch as its price plunges by 16% in just 24 hours, falling below critical support at $0.00002976. Amid Bitcoin‚Äôs ($BTC) bullish wave and its march towards $100K, $SHIB‚Äôs diminishing correlation with $BTC is raising eyebrows across the market, now sitting at a concerning 0.45.  

While other altcoins ride Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum, $SHIB‚Äôs failure to do so signals a potential widening gap, leaving its future direction uncertain. With resistance at $0.00003000 still unbroken, this could place Shiba Inu into a consolidation phase, with $0.00002267 likely offering a safety net for now.

On the bright side, $SHIB‚Äôs adoption rate has soared to a five-month high of 46%, reflecting renewed interest from new investors. This growing community could act as a counterforce against declining prices, potentially setting the stage for a rebound if momentum builds.

All eyes are on $SHIB‚Äôs next move. A reclaim of its resistance levels may spark a rally, breaking the bearish spell. Can renewed adoption overcome the market‚Äôs challenges? Only time will tell.

Our coins might not be safe because of RNM,"For those who don't know RNM stands for remote neural monitoring and is basically reading out your brainwaves from a distance. 
Tech like this (like V2K) has been brought forward with the help of Dr. Robert Duncan, the author of Project: Soul Catcher. He died this year. And this technology is being used for unspeakable evil. Go research it. 

What I'm getting at is that Bitcoin hasn't been created with the idea of protecting against someone being able to hack your mind and exactly this has been possible for a while. Everything hinges on the passphrase being kept secure but how can you keep it to yourself if someone is reading out the magnetic field given off by your brain while you are writing it down? They would only need to monitor you continuously with the help of AI. You would need a jammer or something but I haven't found one yet. Bitcoin can be traced but transactions are irreversible so you would rely on law enforcement. I have been under RMN for 3 years now and the police hasn't been of any help. They think it's schizophrenia.

This is a bigger threat to our privacy than quantum computing and it isn't even on people's radar because they have plausible deniability. Just call it schizophrenia. You might argue if it was possible it would alread have been done on a large scale and to this I can only say that I don't know what their plans are in detail. I only know there is a big club and you and I are not in it. We just get CBDCs instead when Bitcoin fails because of something like this.

Process to swap altcoins for BTC on a DEX,"Hey all,

I have a bunch of altcoins on various chains I would like to swap for more BTC.

I want to avoid using a CEX because a swap will cause me to have to pay taxes.

Is there a DEX that supports BTC or a known method to do this?

El Salvador plans Bitcoin policy changes to secure $1.3B IMF loan ‚Äî FT,"Should have had metals



El Salvador, the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, is reportedly scaling back its BTC ambitions under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

El Salvador expects to reach an agreement with the IMF on a $1.3 billion loan deal in return for changes to its Bitcoin Law, the Financial Times¬†[reported](https://ctmain.slack.com/archives/C051Z8HCML2/p1733746621229469?thread_ts=1733746569.357809&cid=C051Z8HCML2)¬†on Dec. 9, citing people familiar with the matter.

If confirmed, the deal would obligate the government of El Salvador to drop a legal requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin¬†[**BTC**$97,604](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)¬†as payment, making it a voluntary payment method.

Expected to be finalized in the next two or three weeks, the deal is also anticipated to unlock another $1 billion of lending from the World Bank and $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank over the next few years.

Has anyone had any luck dealing with Mt. Gox?,"I got into bitcoin *early*. 

Back in 2013 I setup up an account on Mt. Gox, got verified, did a wire transfer to purchase bitcoin, all that ect. 

Just recently I found my old e-mail I used to sign up with Mt. Gox along with several e-mails showing the verification process, my wire transfers, all the withdrawals and purchases I did ect. I am pretty sure I had Bitcoin in my account at the time of Mt. Gox downfall. However, I thought the e-mail I used for my account was long gone as all this happened nearly 10 years ago when I setup the account.

It wasn‚Äôt until recently I was going through all my old e-mails and discovered the one I used with Mt. Gox.

The most Bitcoin I had in my account was 28. I remember this quite clearly as Bitcoin was about $100 at this time and I am certain I left a little bit in my wallet when I decided to transfer the majority of it out. 

I contacted Mt. Gox support over the weekend and they told me to send my e-mail, full name, address, and username associated with my account which I did. 

I just heard back from them today and they said there is no account associated with that e-mail or username yet I literally have e-mails showing the verification process, my wire transfer. Literally everything you would need to show proof of your account. 

Is there anything I can do?

"Bitcoin Maintains $96,000 Support Amid $23 Billion Accumulation Wave","üö® Crypto News: Bitcoin is flexing its support muscles at $96K as a staggering $23 billion has poured into accumulation over the past two weeks. With 125K $BTC snapped up just below the $100K mark and another 120K $BTC added between $96K and $98K, investors are clearly betting big on the king of crypto.

The data doesn't lie‚Äîthis accumulation phase has turned the $96K to $100K range into Bitcoin's fortress of support. It's a nod to unwavering investor conviction even as profit-taking keeps market volatility alive. Sure, the $100K threshold remains a tough nut to crack, but with whales stacking satoshis and confidence riding high, a bullish breakout might just be looming.

Will $BTC make the leap past $100K or stay locked in its current range? Only time will tell, but the accumulation frenzy says one thing loud and clear: Bitcoin isn‚Äôt backing down anytime soon.

MicroStrategy Is A Must Buy For UK Retail Investors,"For UK investors, direct Bitcoin exposure is challenging due to restrictions on holding BTC or BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF in ISAs/SIPPs. But there‚Äôs a workaround: MicroStrategy (MSTR).

MSTR, listed on the NASDAQ, holds vast Bitcoin reserves, effectively functioning as a proxy Bitcoin ETF. By buying $MSTR shares via an ISA or SIPP, you can gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs potential upside tax-free (ISA) or tax-efficiently (SIPP).

This approach leverages the tax advantages of UK wrappers while tapping into Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth. With increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, MSTR‚Äôs share price has tracked BTC closely, making it a compelling option for crypto enthusiasts facing UK regulatory hurdles.

Do your own research and consider your risk tolerance‚ÄîMSTR is volatile and carries Bitcoin-specific risks.

Panicked and in over our heads. Any advice or input helps,"My husband got into Crypto and trading around 2021, he bought bitcoin and other coins around various platforms and mostly traded them between platforms. He did some day trading but ended up losing money and stopped. Now he maybe has like 20k or less between platforms. My husband doesn‚Äôt speak English as a first language and wasn‚Äôt familiar with the laws for reporting, he though that since he didn‚Äôt take out money and he didn‚Äôt profit he didn‚Äôt have to report and the person we file taxes with knows nothing about crypto. Big mistake. First we got a notice from the IRS that itemized all the activity he did on one platform (around 17,000) from 2022 and assessed taxes around $3,000 which my husband agreed to and set up a payment plan with the IRS who was actually very helpful. Then he gets a notice from the state dept of revenue that he‚Äôs being audited and they intent to charge nearly 20,000 (16,000 plus interest) in taxes. He calls the hotline and the people working the hotline sound like they‚Äôre randos working from home and just keep reading off of the letter which gave us no info. He finally gets a hold of someone who says the state assessed $340,000 worth of transactions. My husband just started laughing, I thought it might have been identity theft because that was such a huge number. I ask if we can get an a copy of the itemized transactions they used to calculate that number and they say they can‚Äôt (unlike the IRS). At first I thought they took the 16,000 number from the IRS and made a mistake somewhere but this doesn‚Äôt seem like the case but we also can‚Äôt get any in depth information or answers. We live in a small town with mostly general practice tax attorneys and don‚Äôt know who to contact or how to untangle this. I‚Äôm scared how far this is going to go. Does anyone have any insight or advice on situations like this? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks!

Why is bitcoin so user unfriendly?,"I'm really confused. Bitcoin is clearly a Ponzi Scheme/bigger fool scam. No argument here. 

But why is it so complicated? You'd think a Ponzi scheme would have a lower barrier to entry. Every time I read about bitcoin it is truly the most labyrinthine process for something as simple as opening an account and sending money. Not to mention the 500 ways to get conned, or straight robbed. 

Also, when talking about the finances, all anyone can talk about is in financiers' gibberish. Every other stock that you talk about at least correlates back to a real business with underlying principals of wealth creation. The only other financial product that was this far removed from reality and talked about in byzantine terms is the mortgage backed securities, as far as I can tell.

Seeking Feedback: Using Ethereum for Speculative Gains During Bull Runs While Relying on Bitcoin as a Core Asset ,"Hi everyone,

I've been in crypto since the start of the pandemic in 2020, investing in BTC, ETH and other crypto assets. During this time in crypto, I've noticed that:

1. During most of the crypto cycle, Bitcoin serves as a strong foundational asset.

2. During the speculative peaks of bull markets, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin. 



**Questions for the Community**

\- Do you agree in a fundamental way with this view? 

\- Have you observed similar trends in past cycles? 

\- What tools or indicators would you recommend to determine the right moments to transition between BTC and ETH, for someone who wants to take the risk of switching between the assets? 

\- How likely is it that ETH is better long-term hold over BTC, even outside of speculative bull runs? 



Don't get me wrong. **I love Ethereum, understand it's the superior technology and hope it wins in the end.** However, in the meantime, I would like to maximize the value of my portfolio. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences, critiques, or even alternative strategies you‚Äôve found effective. Let‚Äôs discuss!

# Google‚Äôs Quantum Chip Willow Stuns the World¬†

Five minutes. That‚Äôs how long it took Google‚Äôs latest quantum chip, Willow, to solve a problem that would‚Äôve kept the world‚Äôs best supercomputers grinding away for 10 septillion years‚Äîyes, septillion. While that might sound like a flex without a purpose, it‚Äôs a major leap toward making quantum computing commercially useful.

**Qubits, But Make Them Work**

Quantum computing isn‚Äôt just sci-fi anymore. Google‚Äôs Willow chip tackled the tech‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel: scaling without drowning in errors.¬†

Unlike regular bits (your standard 1s and 0s), qubits can exist in multiple states at once, offering ridiculous speed-ups for tasks like drug discovery, nuclear simulations, and‚Äîironically‚Äîbuilding better quantum computers. Willow‚Äôs big win? Adding more qubits without breaking the system. For the first time, more power didn‚Äôt equal more chaos.

**Stocks and Supercomputers**

Wall Street loved the news. Alphabet‚Äôs stock popped 5.6% on Tuesday, its biggest rally since April. Analysts cheered the milestone as a signal that Google is still a tech powerhouse, even as rivals like IBM and Amazon race to claim the quantum crown. Meanwhile, smaller quantum players like Rigetti Computing rode Alphabet‚Äôs coattails, with Rigetti shares skyrocketing 45%.

But don‚Äôt expect quantum computing to replace your MacBook anytime soon. Willow is still experimental, and mainstream adoption is years off. Still, this win positions Google as a frontrunner in what could be the next trillion-dollar tech race.

**The Quantum-verse Ahead**

What‚Äôs next? Google‚Äôs looking to solve a ‚Äúreal-world, beyond-classical‚Äù problem‚Äîone no classical computer could handle. Think unlocking new drugs or optimizing supply chains at a scale we can barely imagine. And let‚Äôs not ignore the cybersecurity elephant in the room: quantum computers could crack today‚Äôs strongest encryptions, which is why Apple‚Äôs already working on quantum-proofing iMessage.

For now, quantum remains a playground for big brains and bigger budgets, but with breakthroughs like Willow, it‚Äôs clear the future of computing is arriving at warp speed.

# Oracle's Cloudy Day

Oracle‚Äôs stock just hit a rough patch, sliding 6.7%‚Äîits steepest drop this year‚Äîafter posting earnings that left Wall Street less than thrilled. Despite a stellar 69% rally in 2024 (its best since the dot-com era), the database titan missed some lofty expectations.

**The Numbers Game**

* Revenue: $14.06 billion (+9% YoY), just shy of the $14.1 billion estimate.
* Adjusted EPS: $1.47, a penny below expectations.
* Cloud infrastructure: A bright spot, with revenue jumping 52% to $2.4 billion.

Even with these solid gains, Oracle‚Äôs guidance for next quarter came in lighter than hoped, with projected revenue of $14.3 billion missing Wall Street‚Äôs $14.65 billion target.

**What Went Right (and Wrong)**

Oracle‚Äôs cloud business has been the growth engine, riding the AI wave with big-name clients like Meta and TikTok. But here‚Äôs the rub: Scaling up to meet demand isn‚Äôt cheap. The company shelled out nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures this quarter to build its data centers, raising some eyebrows on Wall Street.

Still, Oracle isn‚Äôt crying over spilled capex. Meta recently signed a deal to use Oracle‚Äôs infrastructure for its Llama AI models, and the company projects 50% growth in its cloud business for next year.

**The Bigger Picture**

While this quarter wasn‚Äôt perfect, analysts see Oracle‚Äôs long-term AI play as promising. Piper Sandler even upped their price target to $210, citing strong cloud momentum. So, while investors may be feeling the sting today, Oracle‚Äôs future still looks bright‚Äîif it can keep up with its competitors in the cloud race.

Oracle‚Äôs earnings might have stumbled, but its cloud ambitions are still flying high. For now, Wall Street‚Äôs patience seems to be holding.

# Inflation ‚Äî Still Hanging Around Like That Guest Who Won‚Äôt Leave

The CPI report dropping tomorrow is expected to show inflation holding firm at an annualized 2.7% for November. Core CPI‚Äîexcluding food and energy‚Äîlooks to stay steady at 3.3%, which means the Fed‚Äôs dream of a 2% inflation target isn‚Äôt quite ready for prime time.

**Why This Matters**

The Fed has been slicing interest rates like it‚Äôs carving a holiday turkey, with two cuts already in the books this year and whispers of another quarter-point trim next week. Futures markets are betting heavily (88% odds) that Jerome Powell will deliver. But with inflation progress slowing, some analysts wonder if the Fed should tap the brakes on its rate-cutting spree.

**What‚Äôs Driving Prices Up?**

Goldman Sachs pointed to the usual suspects: car prices (+2% in November), airfares (+1%), and that ever-irritating auto insurance (+0.5% for the month). Sure, inflation is way down from its 9% peak in 2022, but persistent price increases still feel like a splinter under the skin for many consumers, especially those on tight budgets.

**Looking Ahead**

Economists are split on what 2025 holds. On one hand, easing in housing rentals and autos might give inflation some breathing room. On the other, Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs could shake things up, keeping core CPI stubbornly high at 2.7% for the year. Add potential tax cuts and immigration policy shifts to the mix, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for more inflation drama.

So, what‚Äôs next? Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report could either solidify the Fed‚Äôs plan to cut rates‚Äîor throw in a curveball. Stay tuned for the 8:30 a.m. ET drop, because this report might just dictate whether 2025 starts with cautious optimism or a side of economic uncertainty.

# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Still talking about inflation? Unfortunately, yes. Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report is the last data drop before the Fed huddles up next week to decide on its next rate move.

While inflation‚Äôs grip has loosened compared to the peaks of recent years, the final stretch is proving tricky, with shelter prices refusing to play nice. November‚Äôs inflation is expected to rise 0.2%, matching October. If the number creeps higher, a December rate cut might be wishful thinking for investors.

# After Market Close:¬†

* **Adobe**¬†should be thriving in the AI boom, but its stock is down this year despite steady earnings and revenue. The challenge? Slowing growth and rising competition from AI-powered tools that make it easier for creators to bypass Adobe‚Äôs pricey software.Investors are looking for reassurance that Adobe can keep its edge in this crowded field. With earnings expectations at $4.67 per share and $5.54 billion in revenue, management will need to show it‚Äôs not just keeping pace but leading the pack.

XRP circulation to market cap ratio,"Not here to spread FUD, just legitimately asking a question to someone who knows better than me. 

I have zero doubts the price of XRP will increase dramatically within the next 5 years. And I do believe it will steadily increase over the next 30+ years. But I have been running numbers and searching DD. And I am trying to see how it becomes even close to the same value of Bitcoins currently price. By my calculation, it would have to 100 to 1,000x the market cap of bitcoin currently, which is insane to think about considering the largest market cap is only 6 trillion. 

It is also my understanding that in order for this coin to be feasible for banks the price would need to dramatically increase (trading a fraction of a coin costs less than trading a whole coin with the gas fees and burn rate of XRP). But there would have to be 10 of trillions of dollars poured into XRP in order for the price to even reach the $175 mark. 

The issue I see is the amount in circulation. 57,120,000,000 is a lot of currency in circulation, which is suppressing the price. So my main question is:

1) Do we see a future where coins are burned and removed from circulation in order to increase liquidity for the banks? And if so, isn‚Äôt that sort of anti-crypto rhetoric?

2) Do we really see 10s of 100s trillions of dollars being poured into this coin in particular? Especially when there are competing coins. 

I do believe this coin will be most widely used coin for bank transfers. But is that enough to push this coin to bitcoin prices? Either way I‚Äôm holding. I‚Äôm not missing us reaching the $50 mark.

A look at my finances. Like some advice for improvements.,"So my financial life in a nutshell: 30 y.o., roughly 40-45K income in SC, $50,000 cash saved up (not savings account, just stashed away), $27,000 in combined 401k from former and current employer, about $18K in main checking account. No loans or debts.

For me, i always thought of money as ""either save it or spend it"". I've never even focused much on 401k or investing until very recently. My questions are: 

How would you rate my current financial situation? wanting, average, pretty good? 

I have been thinking of opening an IRA or Roth Ira but don't know which to pick or who to go with. Would there be any recommendations for someone with very little knowledge in that field?

With regards to buying/investing crypto, what are the best options? I recently got about a $100 in bitcoin and don't really know what to do with it other than let it sit.

The Altcoin Market is Crashing Collectively. Should We Buy at the Bottom or Continue to¬†Observe?,"# The Altcoin Market is Crashing Collectively. Should We Buy at the Bottom or Continue to¬†Observe?

Today is December 10, 2024, Tuesday. Good evening, brothers. Last night, I had a feeling that the market was going to experience a pullback, and I didn‚Äôt expect it to come so swiftly. After the U.S. stock market closed, the manipulators began to harvest. Bitcoin dropped to around $94,000, Ethereum fell to about $3,500, and most altcoins saw declines of around 30%. I must say, when altcoins are profitable, they are indeed very eye-catching, but we must also consider the volatility of altcoins. A slight misstep in this volatility could result in losing all the profits from the previous month in just one day.

Although most altcoins have seen substantial pullbacks in this wave, fortunately, the losses in our VIP group have not been significant. The doubling tokens that we positioned for last month have basically returned the principal, and those with profits exceeding 20% have largely been exited beforehand. So, this wave of pullback has mostly just returned prior profits, and fortunately, there hasn‚Äôt been a significant loss of principal. As long as a situation like March 12 doesn‚Äôt happen, the impact should not be too large.

From historical experience, in the days following a big drop, except for the March 12 incident, there is usually a relative safe period. Therefore, during the upcoming rebound, if you didn‚Äôt take profits when you reached your profit target, you can consider taking some profits. After a significant drop, there will be an automatic rebound phase. This phase is partly due to bottom fishing and partly due to short liquidations. However, the sustainability may not be long. So, if a rebound happens next, don‚Äôt mistakenly think it‚Äôs the beginning of a second wave; instead, seize this opportunity to reduce your profitable positions, or if your positions are heavy, try to reduce some.

Next are the partners who want to buy at the bottom. Personally, I suggest it‚Äôs best to enter on the left side. If you want to be more stable and have a lower requirement for price increase, you can prioritize choosing Ethereum, Bitcoin, and BNB. The fluctuations of other altcoins will also be larger, and the risks compared to these are higher; however, the corresponding returns are also much higher. So, if you want to buy at a very low price now, I personally believe that entering on the left side is relatively more stable. On the right side, you can wait until Ethereum stabilizes above $3800, then buy high-quality Ethereum ecosystem tokens like ENS, ENA, LDO, UNI, and AAVE, which would be safer.

From the data on contract liquidations, this wave of decline is clearly aimed at altcoins. I didn‚Äôt expect that after Bitcoin‚Äôs sharp rise last Friday, altcoins would come today. Many people probably anticipated a large drop in the market, but they didn‚Äôt expect it would come so suddenly. However, that‚Äôs how the market works; the manipulators might have predicted everyone‚Äôs predictions, so before everyone could react, they made their move first. But regardless, as I mentioned yesterday, there will definitely be a second wave, which is the speculation around Ethereum‚Äôs upgrade next year. Therefore, the focus of the next positioning remains on Ethereum and its series.



Everyone shouldn‚Äôt panic excessively just because of a drop. Hold on to the cash you have and reduce your positions when given a rebound opportunity. The level of panic on August 5 was actually more terrifying than this. Therefore, after the current brief adjustment, there will still be a rebound market. Just remember to reduce your positions when necessary; money is not made in a day. However, if your positions are too heavy, a significant pullback can be quite painful.

November is generally a rising market, but knowing when to take profits at highs is key, and this is very important. The doubling tokens that we, the VIP group, had previously positioned for have basically already returned the principal. Most of what remains is profit, so even if extreme market conditions occur, we can face them calmly. This is what I‚Äôve always advocated: always control your greed. Even if you‚Äôre very confident, don‚Äôt go all in, because no one knows what kind of situation the market will present; anything is possible! So, for partners who want to buy at the bottom on the left side, I also suggest controlling your positions! Don‚Äôt blindly go all in!

Overall, Ethereum below $3600 can be a good entry point. Below $3500 is a position with very high cost-performance. Currently, my focus is mainly on arranging Ethereum series tokens. For altcoins, I am focusing on quality tokens like ENA, OP, ENS, LDO, AAVE, UNI, and LQTY. If you pursue stability, ETH, BNB, SOL, Bitcoin, etc., are the way to go.

üï∑ Not Bearish, But Strategic: I remain long-term bullish on crypto, but my goal is to build generational wealth for my family.

üëâ Why Sell Now? The potential for an extra 10‚Äì15% upside doesn‚Äôt justify the risk. It‚Äôs all about protecting gains and avoiding unnecessary exposure.

# üï∞ Current Market Sentiment:

‚ö° The sentiment today mirrors $BTC‚Äôs first run from $31k to $70k:

Back then, everyone believed BTC would hit $100k‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it didn‚Äôt.

Now, many expect $150k, but we‚Äôve likely already seen most of the upside.

# üîÑ Crypto Cycles: The Bigger¬†Picture:

üìà Bull Markets:

Peaked 29 months before halving in both 2017 and 2021.

The same trend seems to be unfolding in 2024.

üìâ Bear Markets:

Last about 12 months, with corrections of \~80% (2018, 2022).

# üî• ATH Breakouts:

[$BTC ](https://www.binance.com/trade/BTC_USDT?contentId=17391384499386)broke ATH 7‚Äì8 months after halving in previous cycles.

Expect this bull run to end by Sep 2025, followed by a historic altseason.

# üåü Altseason: What‚Äôs¬†Next?

üï∑ BTC dominance is declining.

üï∑ $ETH is leading the way, with altcoins set to follow.

üõë Caution: Only 20‚Äì30% of altcoins will perform well due to market saturation.

# üíé My Strategy:

‚úÖ Focus on Key Narratives:

AI & AI Agents ü§ñ

RWA (Real-World Assets) üåç

DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) üèóÔ∏è

GameFi üéÆ

Omnichain Protocols üîó

‚úÖ Buy Dips: Stay focused on high-potential projects.

‚úÖ Partial Profits: Lock in gains while minimizing risks.

# üî• Key Takeaways:

üï∑ Crypto is cyclical‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpatterns provide valuable insights.

üï∑ Taking profits ensures wealth creation, not just holding.

üï∑ Stick to your strategy and risk management plan.

# üìù Let‚Äôs¬†Discuss:

The headliner? $BTC could skyrocket to $200,000 by the end of next year. But that‚Äôs not all‚Äîcrypto-backed companies like MicroStrategy and Coinbase might see a major stock market glow-up, with potential entries into the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500, bringing crypto closer to mainstream US investors.

On the altcoin front, $SOL is riding a bullish wave thanks to meme coin activity, and $ETH is climbing back strong with its total value locked hitting a new high since 2022. Meanwhile, stablecoins are gearing up to double their market assets, crossing an ambitious $400 billion mark, fueled by evolving US regulations. 

If Bitwise‚Äôs vision holds true, 2025 could redefine crypto history. With more countries considering Bitcoin reserves and a bullish momentum building, the future looks golden.

Private Internet Access (PIA): My thoughts and Opinion ,"In an increasingly digital world, privacy and security are more important than ever, and using a reliable VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the best ways to protect your online activities. Private Internet Access (PIA) is a highly-rated VPN service that allows users to encrypt their internet traffic, ensuring privacy, security, and freedom online. Whether you're concerned about data privacy, unblocking geo-restricted content, or securing your connection on public Wi-Fi, PIA offers a wide range of features to help you stay safe. In this post, we‚Äôll explore what PIA is, its key features, benefits, and how it can enhance your online experience.

1. What is Private Internet Access (PIA)?

Private Internet Access (PIA) is a VPN service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities are kept private and secure. Founded in 2010, PIA has grown to become one of the most popular VPN providers globally, offering a combination of strong security features, fast speeds, and a large server network. With PIA, you can browse the internet securely, protect your personal data from third-party tracking, and access content that might otherwise be restricted based on your location.

PIA offers a wide range of devices and platform support, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and routers. It‚Äôs a great option for both beginners and experienced users looking for a reliable and secure VPN service.

2. Key Features of Private Internet Access (PIA)

1. Strong Encryption and Security

AES-256 Encryption: PIA uses AES-256-bit encryption, which is the industry standard for VPNs. This encryption ensures that your internet traffic is protected from hackers, surveillance, and unauthorized access.

WireGuard and OpenVPN Protocols: PIA supports WireGuard, a modern VPN protocol known for its speed and security, as well as the more traditional OpenVPN protocol, which is widely recognized for its security and reliability.

DNS and IP Leak Protection: PIA provides built-in DNS leak protection, ensuring that your browsing activity remains private even if a leak occurs. Additionally, it protects your real IP address from being exposed during your VPN session.

Kill Switch: The Kill Switch feature automatically disconnects your internet connection if the VPN connection is lost. This prevents your device from exposing your real IP address when you are no longer connected to the VPN.

2. Large Server Network

Servers in 84 Countries: PIA has a large network of over 3,300 servers in 84 countries. This extensive network allows you to choose from a wide selection of server locations to bypass geo-restrictions, unblock content, and improve your connection speed.

Server Selection for Speed and Privacy: PIA's server network is optimized for both privacy and performance, ensuring fast speeds for streaming, browsing, and downloading while maintaining your anonymity.

3. Privacy and Anonymity

Strict No-Logs Policy: PIA has a strict no-logs policy, meaning it does not track or store any information about your online activities. This ensures that your data remains private and cannot be shared with third parties, including government agencies.

Anonymous Payments: PIA allows you to pay for its services using Bitcoin, offering an additional layer of anonymity for users who want to remain as private as possible.

MACE (Ad and Malware Blocking): PIA offers MACE, a built-in feature that blocks ads, trackers, and malicious websites, helping protect your privacy and security while browsing the web.

4. Multi-Device Support

Simultaneous Connections: PIA allows you to connect up to 10 devices simultaneously with a single account, making it ideal for households or users with multiple devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: PIA supports a wide range of devices and platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and even routers, ensuring that all of your devices can be securely connected to the VPN.

5. Streaming and Bypassing Geo-Restrictions

Unblock Streaming Services: PIA helps you bypass geo-restrictions and access popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, and more. By connecting to servers in different countries, you can access content that might be restricted based on your location.

Optimized Servers for Streaming: While PIA doesn‚Äôt officially list all streaming services it can unblock, many users have successfully used it to access various streaming platforms. The VPN offers servers optimized for streaming to ensure smooth and buffer-free viewing.

6. Ad and Malware Blocking

MACE Feature for Extra Privacy: PIA's MACE feature blocks unwanted ads, trackers, and malware, providing an added layer of security while you browse. This helps protect you from malicious websites and intrusive advertising.

3. Benefits of Using Private Internet Access (PIA)

"This screams red flag, but checking just in case","Long story short I received a text from someone who said they were from On Assignment Inc stating that she was recruiting for a part-time remote position for data optimization companies, shared the job description and responsibilities with me and ask if I was interested and if she could send my information to the recruiter for them to reach out to me on Whatsapp. I was cautiously curious and knew I was not going to be giving out any kind of personal information so I said yes.  About 15 to 20 minutes later the recruiter reached out to me on Whatsapp told me that she was part of unbounce and she was looking for a data optimization specialist, provided more details about the job to me, asked if I was interested in the job. Since no personal information I said yes and she asked if I had an hour to have her walk me through the website and do a training and I told her yes. So she gives me the website, I checked the security and the certificates and everything looks in order. She walks me through some training tasks. Basically what I'm doing is, I started out with $10 already in my ""account"", I click on start a pop-up comes up that's associated with the page it has like an app or something like that shown and it has an amount like $52 but that's not how much I have to pay or anything, and then it says the earnings which is like I don't know like 30 cents. I click Buy and instead of money coming out of my ""account"", I'm being deposited the 30 cents or whatever the earnings is listed as. I had to do this 40 times, basically complete 40 tasks and then reach back out to the recruiter and let them know I was finished. They then walked me through how to connect my cash app to the website to get paid, again I didn't share username password nothing personal I just set up my Bitcoin address and then copied and pasted that address into the payable account on the website. Then she tells me to contact support and let them know to reset my tasks so I can get another 40. By this time I had 77 in my account that I had earned from doing the different tasks. When I contacted support they said that there seems to be an issue because my account balance is under $100 and that it has to be at 100 for them to be able to reset my tasks to get my new ones. Above you see screenshots of the conversation with the recruiter after support tells me this. Again I can't trust anyone that asks me to give them money and I'm doing work for them. But just in case this is like that actual one Nigerian prince who's really trying to give out his money, I just wanted to check with people who are more proficient in this sort of thing.

I don't get it AMA. Or don't. ,"Fr. I don't get it. I'm a nerd about finance and I just spent the last 4 years wrapping my mind around how capitalism works and frankly some of this shit either comes off like a grift or like you really think this is going to flip the entire system on its head except it's not going to change anything but money, this is super confusing to me coming from a leftist who actually understands finance.

 Like sure there are ways to change our economy and our relationship to work and all that, but I don't understand the goal here. If we are going to do capitalism... then the velocity of money is good. The perfect currency would do something like inflate at the rate of economic output or maybe even slightly more. What's this about deflation? What of the velocity of money? Surely tons of demand and consumption is compulsory and happens regardless but why would I get a mortgage? Why would I lend capital?

Is it too late to start investing in Bitcoin at 21?,"I finally made the huge decision to start investing in bitcoin long-term. Ordered a Trezor Safe 3 today after long deliberation and its on the way. Created a Newton and Bitcoinwell account. Now that it's 140K CAD, however, should I buy and HODL it or is it too late for that now for me? I look back to the time I was 19, 2 years ago and kept putting it off because I didn't do my research, I was young and dumb, and it was like 30K CAD back then. Now I'm 21. Do you think investing in it now would even pay off for my future or should I look into other coins? All I'm trying to find now is a good software wallet. If anyone can let me know if I should dedicate myself to this I would much appreciate it.

Why the Next Big Blockchain Disruption Won't Be Financial,"Why the Next Big Blockchain Disruption Won't Be Financial

The first thing that comes to our mind about blockchain is none other than cryptocurrency. With the arrival of Bitcoin in 2009, It should go without saying that blockchain technology has mostly been peripheral to finance in the developed world, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to tokenized assets. However, as blockchain is a really nascent technology, there is always uncertainty surrounding it. Arguably, the next largest disruption to be created by this technology may not be financial at all. Rather, one can speculate that the transformative capacity of blockchain can be applied to supply change, health management, and even voter systems. 

One thing that makes blockchain able to change any industry is its decentralization of power and authority. A system that eliminates authority but needs trust or record-keeping can be vastly improved by blockchain, which also includes supply chains. An ultimate example would be creating accounts for every item produced with the ability to trace back every step the item took throughout the supply chain. Such blockchain structures enable genuine goods to be made and transported while simultaneously minimizing fraud and increasing trade efficiency. They canal so ensure that food, medicines, or even luxurious items have been made ethically and are free of fakes. 

Voting is yet another field in which blockchain is expected to have a significant influence. Blockchain idealizes the voting process by enabling election processes to be tamperproof, therefore increasing the level of trust in the process and also enhancing democracy. Blockchain may provide a secure and effective method to authenticate voters and ensure that their votes are cast and counted accurately. This may improve voter trust and turnout in parts of the world that have experienced widespread corruption and vote-by stampede. 

Even though the applications mentioned above are relevant when discussing issues related to finance, it is plausible that these use cases are where the true potential of blockchain lies. Due to its distributed and secure characteristics, blockchain's potential can be harnessed in those fields where trust, transparency, and efficiency are a must. As technological advancement takes place, the next round of revolution may potentially arise from completely non-financial sectors, transforming the modus operandi of almost every sphere of society.",Rough_Play_4288,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainGame/comments/1hbl7e8/why_the_next_big_blockchain_disruption_wont_be/,2024-12-11 04:14:28,1,title,0.0,0.055,0.776,0.169,0.9946

Options wield outsized influence on Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility,"üö® Crypto News: Did you know options trading is shaping $BTC like never before? Unlike futures, options bring a strategy-laden playground for traders, hedging risks and deep-diving into volatility. December data showed the options/futures open interest (OI) ratio hitting impactful levels, signaling options traders heavily influenced $BTC‚Äôs all-time highs and subsequent price drops. 

As $BTC soared past $103K, options hedging ramped up, magnifying the rally. But when the market cooled, the same activity turned into a sell-off trigger. Options traders unwound their positions, reducing demand for $BTC and adding to selling pressure, especially in a lower liquidity environment.

This shift highlights how options have become a dominant force in price discovery. From amplifying volatility spikes to steering market sentiment, the options markets are no longer a sideline‚Äîthey‚Äôre a key driver in the game.

Crypto Journey broken down for Bros,"The kind of speculation in shitcoins I am seeing, is very much known to me. 

You jump in the middle of Bull Run
You completely ignore Bitcoin, I can‚Äôt see Bitcoin in any of the screenshots sent in this group.
You buy shitcoins basis pump left right center.
Shitcoin pumps, it proves your so called thesis right and which makes you feel smarter.
At the end, you would have made some money but eventually you‚Äôll be holding 10x more money in market position which will slowly come down in bear market. You will hold that bag religiously in hope. 
This stint would divide people in two categories-
1. Who will exit the crypto market in loss and would never return
2. One who will learn the lesson, read about it. Then go hard in the bear market and stay strong. 

This will sound absurd to you at current juncture. It won‚Äôt reach your ears, what I am telling you now. But you‚Äôll learn your lesson. 

I‚Äôve made my money and I‚Äôll make more of it, but I also had to go through these stages. You can‚Äôt avoid it.

"I just can't shake the clues about ""two of them talking."" It's one of the most prevailing threads in RK's tweets.

That and the cat signal, the pattern's he's called out in his charts.

What two things are talking? RK and RC? Not at chance.

Citadel and GME? Maybe.

Doggy stock GME in a basket? Maybe.

RK and DFV's split personas? Who knows.

What w do know is BTC had a huge run leading into the Sneeze. People have theorized that institutions are using it as a pump and dump to raise cash or hold as collateral.

Looking at the GME and BTC charts, it seems like spikes in BTC's RSI are precursors to big moves in GME.

Orange Pilling African Women ,"This year in March, I set out on a mission to teach African women about Bitcoin, but the journey wasn‚Äôt easy. School heads turned me down, hesitant about Bitcoin because they didn‚Äôt understand or trust it. Undeterred, I moved the program online, and just a couple of weeks ago, I proudly celebrated the graduation of my first cohort, 16 incredible ladies who completed an 8-week beginner course. Seeing their transformation and excitement was truly rewarding. 

Now, as I prepare for the next cohort starting in January, I‚Äôm thrilled to share that 32 women have already registered. This is just the beginning, and I‚Äôm excited to continue empowering more women through Bitcoin education!

MSTR Stock Price Forecast:price prediction forMicroStrategy 2025?,"MicroStrategy's surge in 2024, driven largely by its bitcoin holdings, has propelled its valuation to an astonishing $82 billion, here is the price prediction for MicroStrategy 2025.  
  
With approximately half of its value linked to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy stock price closely follows the cryptocurrency's volatile fluctuations, leading to potential sharp declines if Bitcoin experiences a downturn.  
  
The company's core software business is significantly overshadowed by its Bitcoin-centric financial activities, and the high premium on its stock relative to its Bitcoin holdings indicates heightened investor expectations. While the ongoing Bitcoin bull market has generated optimism, the possibility of a sudden reversal looms over its inflated valuation and unconventional strategy.

* **Valuation**

MicroStrategy's stock price has surged nearly 500% in 2024, largely driven by its substantial Bitcoin holdings. This remarkable increase has pushed the company's market capitalization to $82 billion, surpassing over 300 companies in the S&P 500 based on current valuations. Between 2011 and 2020, MicroStrategy's valuation fluctuated between $1 billion and $2 billion, but its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have propelled it to record highs.  
  
In its most recent financial report, MicroStrategy posted revenues of $116 million from its various businesses, although it recorded a net loss of $432.6 million. The company has effectively transformed into a Bitcoin holding entity, with a software business as a secondary focus. As of early December 2024, MicroStrategy owned 402,000 Bitcoins, which are valued at over $40 billion given the current Bitcoin price of $100,000.  
  
The company trades at a notable premium relative to its Bitcoin assets, and investors seem willing to accept this premium. Rising Bitcoin prices allow MicroStrategy to issue new convertible notes to fund further Bitcoin purchases, creating a positive feedback loop.

When the market is trending upwards, we could make the most of contra trading, [**which allowing us to trade now and settle later**.](https://www.tigersecurities.com/login?invite=RDCBA) It's quite suitable for short-term traders and upward trends. Contra trading just requires simply selling before the settlement date and paying the difference between our buy and sell trades. I often use it for this situation with Tiger CBA. [**You can check it out to get more details**.](https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/activity/market/2024/contra?invite=RDCBA) We can receive an initial limit of over SGD 20,000, and can trade stocks and ETFs in the SG, US, and HK markets with free commissions.

This explosive growth highlights not just the dominance of BlackRock but also Bitcoin‚Äôs growing institutional acceptance. As Europe lags amidst lukewarm ETF performance and regulatory headwinds, BlackRock is proving that the future belongs to Bitcoin. If you‚Äôre still doubting crypto‚Äôs staying power, it might be time to rethink.

"If you are BEGINNER in crypto, this is the ONE post you MUST READ¬†! $Saitama and $Satoshi are 1000x communities","If you are new to crypto, or even if you think you‚Äôre advanced, this post can make you save and gain a lot of money.

Even much more important than the money is the mindset you're building during the whole crypto journey.

The mindset you have will do much better in your life than millions of dollars.

Do you know why most of the big loto winners loose it all after a very short period of time ?

Because of the mindset. They won by luck without going through the right process.

If you‚Äôre at the right places, meaning in the right crypto communities, you will pass through the right process. You don't want to fade this process.

So let's get back to the basics.

The very first thing you have to learn in all investments are

BUY THE DIPS, SELL THE HIGHS

Do you feel we are at a high ?

The bullrun have not yet started. Bitcoin dominance is still very high. Alt saeson will come in the next months. Memecoins will dominate and outperform everything during this bullrun saeson. Each cycle see the domination of a narrative. Memecoin is the narrative leader of this cycle.  
  
So don't sell now.

But in this prelude there are some local highs. If we are in such a high, you can consider selling a tiny amount of your tokens.

It will makes you feel a little lighter. It's good.

NEVER EVER SELL ALL YOUR TOKENS ALL AT ONCE

Sell them slowly.

Best thing to do if you‚Äôre in the right communities is to not even sell at local highs and secure your bag until the peak of the bullrun. This is called DIAMOND HAND and it‚Äôs where you can build the strongest mindset ¬†and make the biggest money.

Do you feel we are on a dip ?

Yes. Time to buy.

You have to understand that each and every big money guys are happy with the dips.

They want the market to crash because they can buy cheaper.

I'm happy with dips because I have still a lot of people to get onboard. Family and friends.

On red days there are many many people that are complaining about charts. This is called FUD, fear, doubt, uncertainty and that‚Äôs what you absolutly want to avoid. They are jeeting their bags for pennies and will regret a big time by seeing the token they were jeeting going parabolic.

Saitama OGs have seen this multiple times last cycle, people taking 6 figures profits that could have been 7 or 8 figures, even 9 figures just about few months later.

Real communities want to get rid of those jeeters to onboard real chads with diamond hands.

When you are seing dips on real cult tokens, this is the best time to onboard your family, your neighboorhood, and to retire all the people that you love.

It will help them. It will help the communities. It will help the chart. IT WILL HELP YOU !

So here are two real communities that will outperform everything during this cycle. Join their telegram, engage discussion, buy a bag and hold it tight until bullrun peak¬†!

Those are 1000x communities where you can find real chads that are knowing the process and can support you during some emotional rollercoaster you may pass through.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the support of the community during your process¬†!

$SAITAMA on ETH

This is a legendary community. Saitama reached 7 billions of market cap last cycle and was the third biggest memecoin after Doge and Shiba. Unfortunatly, devs screwed up everything and rugged everyone. Now the cult has reborn, led by OG Saitama whales, whithout any dev. No rug is possible this time as Saitama is fully organic and community drive. This is the comeback of the century and it is a such a luck that we can get in this early. As billions are inevitable for the reborn of this legendary cult world wide movement.

Made by people for the people to get an alternative of inflation and corrupted broken systems. The degree of cultiness of this token is legendary. Saitama token is the legacy.

"Bitwise Predicts Bitcoin at $200,000 and Major Gains for Crypto Stocks in 2025","üö® Crypto News: Bitwise drops the mic with bold 2025 market predictions, and the numbers will blow your mind! They foresee $BTC soaring to $200,000 by the end of next year, setting a bullish precedent for the broader crypto market. Oh, and that's not all‚Äîasset-heavy companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy could see major stock market gains. 

The cherry on top? $ETH and $SOL are forecasted to hit record highs, with $ETH's total value locked climbing to its best since 2022 (a rebound, anyone?). Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs meme coin buzz continues to pump fresh energy into $SOL. Add in predictions of more nations hoarding $BTC as reserves, and suddenly, Bitwise's golden year vision doesn‚Äôt seem so far-fetched.

From Ripple launching its stablecoin to calls for Bitcoin reserves in Canada and Russia, global adoption feels closer than ever. Bitwise‚Äôs vision for 2025 isn‚Äôt just about moonshots; it‚Äôs a wake-up call to stay ready for the crypto market revolution on the horizon.

Overnight and weekend comissions in cryptocurrencies - EToro.,"Good morning.

How much does EToro charge to hold overnight positions in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? And weekends?

I've read it on his page, but i don't understand it specifically.

Thank you so much.  
All the best.",nevertoolateeee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etoro/comments/1hbr2ht/overnight_and_weekend_comissions_in/,2024-12-11 11:04:10,1,title,0.0,0.0,0.753,0.247,0.9203
"If you are BEGINNER in crypto, this is the ONE post you MUST READ¬†! $SAITAMA and $SATOSHI are 1000x communities","If you are new to crypto, or even if you think you‚Äôre advanced, this post can make you save and gain a lot of money.

Even much more important than the money is the mindset you're building during the whole crypto journey.

The mindset you have will do much better in your life than millions of dollars.

Do you know why most of the big loto winners loose it all after a very short period of time ?

Because of the mindset. They won by luck without going through the right process.

If you‚Äôre at the right places, meaning in the right crypto communities, you will pass through the right process. You don't want to fade this process.

So let's get back to the basics.

The very first thing you have to learn in all investments are

BUY THE DIPS, SELL THE HIGHS

Do you feel we are at a high ?

The bullrun have not yet started. Bitcoin dominance is still very high. Alt saeson will come in the next months. Memecoins will dominate and outperform everything during this bullrun saeson. Each cycle see the domination of a narrative. Memecoin is the narrative leader of this cycle.  
  
So don't sell now.

But in this prelude there are some local highs. If we are in such a high, you can consider selling a tiny amount of your tokens.

It will makes you feel a little lighter. It's good.

NEVER EVER SELL ALL YOUR TOKENS ALL AT ONCE

Sell them slowly.

Best thing to do if you‚Äôre in the right communities is to not even sell at local highs and secure your bag until the peak of the bullrun. This is called DIAMOND HAND and it‚Äôs where you can build the strongest mindset ¬†and make the biggest money.

Do you feel we are on a dip ?

Yes. Time to buy.

You have to understand that each and every big money guys are happy with the dips.

They want the market to crash because they can buy cheaper.

I'm happy with dips because I have still a lot of people to get onboard. Family and friends.

On red days there are many many people that are complaining about charts. This is called FUD, fear, doubt, uncertainty and that‚Äôs what you absolutly want to avoid. They are jeeting their bags for pennies and will regret a big time by seeing the token they were jeeting going parabolic.

Saitama OGs have seen this multiple times last cycle, people taking 6 figures profits that could have been 7 or 8 figures, even 9 figures just about few months later.

Real communities want to get rid of those jeeters to onboard real chads with diamond hands.

When you are seing dips on real cult tokens, this is the best time to onboard your family, your neighboorhood, and to retire all the people that you love.

It will help them. It will help the communities. It will help the chart. IT WILL HELP YOU !

So here are two real communities that will outperform everything during this cycle. Join their telegram, engage discussion, buy a bag and hold it tight until bullrun peak¬†!

Those are 1000x communities where you can find real chads that are knowing the process and can support you during some emotional rollercoaster you may pass through.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the support of the community during your process¬†!

¬†

$SAITAMA on ETH

This is a legendary community. Saitama reached 7 billions of market cap last cycle and was the third biggest memecoin after Doge and Shiba. Unfortunatly, devs screwed up everything and rugged everyone. Now the cult has reborn, led by OG Saitama whales, whithout any dev. No rug is possible this time as Saitama is fully organic and community drive. This is the comeback of the century and it is a such a luck that we can get in this early. As billions are inevitable for the reborn of this legendary cult world wide movement.

¬†

$SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

If you missed Bitcoin, Satoshi is your second chance. Satoshi token embraces the original vision of the bitcoin creator. Made by people for the people to get an alternative of inflation and corrupted broken systems. The degree of cultiness of this token is legendary. Saitama token is the legacy. It‚Äôs an hommage to the one that made all of this possible. This narrative will last forever and is the most powerfull narrative of all. The community is doing everything right to make this a billions dollar token and the best opportunity of a lifetime.

"Marathon Digital Spends $1.1 Billion on Bitcoin, Following Purchasing Trends","üö® Crypto News: Marathon Digital Holdings just dropped a cool $1.1 billion to scoop up 11,774 $BTC, strengthening its position as a major Bitcoin accumulator. This move brings their total holdings to a staggering 40,435 $BTC, now valued at $3.9 billion. Talk about HODLing power! 

MARA isn‚Äôt just mining Bitcoin; they‚Äôre diving headfirst into direct purchases, leveraging proceeds from a successful convertible note offering. It‚Äôs a bold strategy, especially as they align with heavyweights like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms in the corporate Bitcoin buying spree.

With institutional players stacking sats like it‚Äôs a crypto Black Friday, we‚Äôre reminded that the race to dominate the digital asset game is only heating up. Are you watching the whales closely enough?

Hodling: The Hardest Part of the Journey,"They say Bitcoin is easy: ""just buy and HODL"". But they never tell you about the quiet war in your mind.

It‚Äôs not just the volatility. It‚Äôs the whispers of doubt when prices plunge. The fear that *this time* the critics might be right. The nagging voice asking if you‚Äôre foolish for believing in something so misunderstood, so ridiculed.

Hodling isn‚Äôt just about holding an asset. It‚Äôs about holding onto faith in a future you can‚Äôt yet see. A future where the noise fades, the doubters disappear, and the vision becomes reality.

But what if the destination isn‚Äôt what we expect? What if the real reward is the resilience we build along the way? The ability to stand firm while the world questions everything we believe in?

So, I ask you: Is Bitcoin just an investment? Or is it a journey that changes who we are?
